# 3D computer graphics

> 3D computer graphics, sometimes called CGI, 3D-CGI or three-dimensional
> computer graphics are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of
> geometric data (often Cartesian) that is stored in the computer for the
> purposes of performing calculations and rendering digital images, usually 2D
> images but sometimes 3D images. The resulting images may be stored for viewing
> later (possibly as an animation) or displayed in real time.\
