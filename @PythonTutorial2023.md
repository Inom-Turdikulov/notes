My notes taken from the Python Tutorial. This tutorial is cover basic concepts
of Python, most noteworthy features and language elements.

# [1. Whetting Your Appetite](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)

In this section described when Python usable. For example scripting, simple GUI,
etc.

Also described strong points of Python, such as rapid development, interactive,
integration, batteries-included, etc.

Moreover, are given difference between Python and other languages, such as C,
C++, Java, etc.

# [2. Using the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html)

- Start interactive interpreter mode: `python3`.
- Exit <kbd>C-d</kbd>, <kbd>C-z</kbd> or `quit()`.
- Interpreter support [[GNU readline]] library.
- `python -c` - execute Python code.
- `python -m [arg]` - execute Python module.
- `python -i` - start interactive interpreter mode, can be combined with `-c`
  and `-m`.

Python support argument parsing. You can use `sys.argv` to get arguments.
Minimal length of `sys.argv` is 1, can be empty, script name (`python -`, `-` is
standard input) or module name (`python -m -i lzma`).

In `sys.argv` also stored `-c` (not sure) and `-m` arguments.

By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in [[unicode|UTF-8]], but
standard library only use [[ascii]] characters for identifiers, this convention
that any portable code should follow.

If you need to set not UTF-8 encoding, use `# -*- coding: encoding -*-` comment
as first line or after [[shebang (unix)]]:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1251 -*-
```

# [3. An Informal Introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)

```python
# this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
```

Testing Python as Calculator:

```python
print(2 + 2)  # int
print(50 - 5*6) # int
print((50 - 5*6) / 4) # float
print(8 / 5)  # division always returns a floating point number in Python!
              # but better use explicit float format - printf(8.0 / 5.0)
# in C - truncation toward zero if both operands are integers
# in Python you can use // operator for same result
print(17 // 3)  # floor division discards the fractional part
print(17 % 3)  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division 5 * 3 + 2
print(17 / 3)  # result 5.666666666666667
print(5 ** 2)  # 5 squared
print(2 ** 7)  # 2 to the power of 7
```

[[operator (computer programming)|Operators]] with mixed type [[operand]]'s
convert the integer operand to floating point

```python
print(4 * 3.75 - 1) # 14.0
```

Set variables:

```python
width = 20
height = 5 * 9
print(width * height)
```

Use undefined variable, will raise `NameError`:

```python
n  # try to access an undefined variable
```

In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable
`_`.

```python
tax = 12.5 / 100  # tax
price = 100.50    # price
price * tax       # 12.5625
price + _         # 113.0625
round(_, 2)       # 113.06
```

Python support various [[data type]]'s such as: Int, Float, Decimal and
Fraction, [[complex number]]'s (using `j` or `J` suffix - `3+5j`).

In Python all these types are objects, so they have methods and attributes.

Python strings:

```python
print('spam eggs')  # single quotes
print('doesn\'t')   # use \' to escape the single quote...
print("doesn't")    # ...or use double quotes instead
print('"Yes, " they said.')
print("\"Yes,\" they said.")
print('"Isn\'t", they said.')
```

In interactive mode [[escape sequence]] not recognized, so use `print()`
function.

You can disable escaping by using raw strings:

```python
print('C:\some\name')   # here \n means newline!
print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
```

A raw string may not end in an odd number of \ characters; see the FAQ ::TODO:
Make clickable :: entry for more information and workarounds.

You can use multiline strings: `\` - used here to prevent printing newline.

```python
print("""\
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
     -h                        Display this usage message
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
""")
```

> Unlike other languages, special characters such as \n have the same meaning
> with both single ('...') and double ("...") quotes. The only difference
> between the two is that within single quotes you donâ€™t need to escape " (but
> you have to escape \') and vice versa.

[[string literal]] can be multiple lines by `"""` triple double or single `'''`
quotes. You can use `\` character to prevent automatically inserting new line in
output (useful for formatting).

You can also concatenate string with `+` operator or by breaking them into new
lines or space. `*` used for repeating string (multiplication).

```python
print(3 * 'un' + 'ium')   # 'unununium'
print('Py' 'thon')        # 'Python'
print('I' "n" r'O' f'm')  # 'InOm'

# This useful for long strings.
text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
        'to have them joined together.')
print(text)  # Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.
print(text + "?")  # concatenation using +
print(f"{text}?")  # concatenation using f-string
print(text.__add__("?"))  # concatenation using __add__ method
```

Strings can be indexed (subscripted). In python no separate character type, a
character is a string of size one.

```python
word = 'Python'
print(word[0])  # character in position 0 <- P
print(word[-0]) # character in position 0 <- P
print(word[5])  # character in position 5 <- n

print(word[-1])  # last character <- n
print(word[-2])  # second last character
print(word[-6]) # first character,

print(word[6])  # IndexError: string index out of range
print(word[-7]) # IndexError: string index out of range
```

Strings can be sliced, to obtain substring

```python
word = "Hello, World!"
print(word[0:5])  # Hello
print(word[:5])   # Hello, offset 5 from start

print(word[5:6])  # ,
print(word[7:13]) # World!

print(word[-6:])  # World!, offest 6 from end
```

Note: `s[:i] + s[i:] == s`

```python
word = "Hello, World!"
print(word[:5] + word[5:]) == word  # True
```

Attempting to use invalid index in range slice handled? ? Gracefully, without
raising an exception.

```python
word = 'Python'
print(word[42:])
print(word[4:42])
```

To remember you can use this table. Think indices are pointing between
characters. How do you think this table is constructed (row 1, 2, 3)?

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| H | e | l | l | o | , |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 .0  .1  .2  .3  .4  .5   6
 -6. -5. -4. -3. -2. -1.
```

Python strings are ==[[immutable object]]'s==.

So you can't assign new value to character in string.

```python
word = 'Python'
word[0] = 'J'    # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
word[2:] = 'py'  # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

But you generate new string by concatenation.

```python
word = 'Python'
print('J' + word[1:])  # Jython
print(word[:2] + 'py') # Pypy
```

String has various built-in methods -
[String Methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

Built-in function `len()` returns length of string.

```python
s = 'WhosYourDaddy ISeedeadpeople'
print(len(s))  # 14
s = 'ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€' 'ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€' 'ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€'
print(len(s))  # 4
```

Most versatile [[data type]] is [[list (abstract data type)]]. In Python list
can contain elements of different types, but usually used one type.

```python
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Lists like [[string literal]] and [[iterator]] can be indexed and sliced.

```python
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares[0])  # indexing returns the item
print(squares[-1])
print(squares[-3:])  # slicing returns a new list
```

All slice operations return a new list (shallow copy) containing the requested
elements.

```python
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares[:])  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Lists also support operations like concatenation.

```python
squares = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]
print(squares + [4, 3, 2, 1])  # [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

List are, mutable, unlike strings.

```python
cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here, let's check 4th element
print(4 ** 3)  # 64, the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!
cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
print(cubes)  # [1, 8, 27, 64, 125] ðŸ˜€

# Adding new element to the end of the list
cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6
cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7
print(cubes)
```

You can also do assignments to lists (inserting/replace), which can change their
size or clear them entirely.

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
# replace some values
letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']
print(letters)  # ['a', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'f', 'g']
# now remove them, shrink list
letters[2:5] = []
print(letters)  # ['a', 'b', 'f', 'g']
# clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list
letters[:] = []
print(letters)
```

List also support built-in functions `len()` and `+`.

```python
print(len(["Hello", "World"]))  # 2
```

You can also use nested lists (list containing other lists).

```python
a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
n = [1, 2, 3]
x = [a, n]
print(x) # [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]
```

[[fibonacci sequence]]:

```python
a, b = 0, 1  # multiple assignment, initialize variables
while a < 10:
    print(a)
    a, b = b, a+b
    # <eval 2nd> = <eval 1st>
    #              eval left-to-right
    # 0, 1
    # 1, 1
    # 1, 2
    # 2, 3
    # 3, 5
```

Order of Evaluation in Python expression ? In Python, the left operand is always
evaluated before the right operand.

Non-zero and (zero or [[null pointer|None]]) values in Python (and C) considered
as ([[boolean data type]])? Non-zero and zero length values considered as? ?
True and False. Length also True and False.

## [4. More Control Flow Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)

[[control flow]] - more info.

```python
if x < 0:
    ...
elif x == 0:
    ...
else:  # optional, sort of default
    print('More')
```

For statement in Python iterates over the sequence items, in the order that they
appear. And finish when sequence is exhausted.

```python
[print(x, end="ðŸ˜®") for x in list("Hnr")]  # HðŸ˜®nðŸ˜®rðŸ˜®
```

> Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can
> be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop
> over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:

```python
# Create a sample collection
users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Ã‰lÃ©onore': 'inactive', 'æ™¯å¤ªéƒŽ': 'active'}

# Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
# this looks interesting
for user, status in users.copy().items():
    if status == 'inactive':
        del users[user]

# Strategy:  Create a new collection
active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
    if status == 'active':
        active_users[user] = status
print(active_users)
```

`range()` is sort of converting given length to known array (`0,1,...,X`). It
generates arithmetic progression.

```python
print(list(range(10))) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
                       # ten isn't included in the generated sequence.
```

You can select range start number (not index). Some like to generate numbers
from X to Y-1.

```python
print(list(range(5, 10)))  # [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

What you will see in interactive python session if you enter this:
`list(range(0, 10))` ?

```python
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

And you can also specify [[increment and decrement operators|increment]] for
step size. Which can be positive or negative.

```python
print(list(range(0, 10, 1)))  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(list(range(0, 10, 2)))  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
print(list(range(0, 10, 3)))  # [0, 3, 6, 9]

# Negative step size will generate sequence in reverse order.
# can be used as alternative to `reversed()`
print(list(range(10, 0, -1)))  # [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(list(range(-10, -100, -30))) # [-10, -40, -70]
print(list(range(-10, 10, 30))) # [-10], first item only
```

To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine `range()` and `len()`
as follows:

```python
a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(i, a[i])
```

But better just use `enumerate()` function.

```python
a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
for i, item in enumerate(a):
    print(i, item)
```

If we don't iterate over range and just print it, we will get object reference.

```python
print(range(10))  # range(0, 10)
```

> The `break` statement, like in C, `breaks out` of the innermost enclosing
> `for` or `while` loop.

::TODO: add #loop into control flow ::

In python [[control flow#loop]] statements may have a `else` clause.

It is executed if loop wasn't `break`ed (we iterated over all items in `for` or
`while` condition become `False`).

::TODO: better review this ::

```python
for n in range(2, 10):
    # multiple loops
    for x in range(2, n):
        if n % x == 0:
            print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
            break
    else:
        # loop fell through without finding a factor
        print(n, 'is a prime number')
```

In `try-except` statement, `else` runs if no exception was raised.

The `continue` statement, continues with the next iteration of the loop:

```python
for num in range(2, 10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Found an even number", num)
        continue
    print("Found an odd number", num)

for num in range(2, 10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Found an even number", num)
    else:
        print("Found an odd number", num)
```

`pass` is a [[null function|null operation]] (statement, while `None` is an
object). When it is executed, nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder
when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed

```python
while True:
    pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)

def f(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

class C: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)

try:
    import platform
except ImportError:
    pass  # this is bad pracitce DO NOT DO THIS
```

::TODO: watch this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-79HGfWmH_w ::

A match statement compare expression with successive patterns until one or more
matches. So this is [[pattern matching]].

> Only the first pattern that matches gets executed and it can also extract
> components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into
> variables.

```python
def http_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad request"
        case 404:
            return "Not found"
        case 418:
            return "I'm a teapot"
        case 500 | 503 | 504: # multiple values in one pattern, `|` is "or"
            return "Not allowed"
        case _:  # _ is a wildcard pattern and never fails to match
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"
```

Patterns can look like unpacking assignments, and can be used to bind variables:

```python
point = (0, 100)

match point:
    case (0, 0):
        print("Origin")
    case (0, y):
        print(f"Y={y}")
    case (x, 0):
        print(f"X={x}")
    case (x, y):  # sort of unpacking assignment
        print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")
    case _:
        raise ValueError("Not a point")
```
