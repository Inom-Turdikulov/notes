Widely considered one of the best practical guides to programming, Steve
McConnell’s original CODE COMPLETE has been helping developers write better
software for more than a decade. Now this classic book has been fully updated
and revised with leading-edge practices—and hundreds of new code
samples—illustrating the art and science of software construction. Capturing the
body of knowledge available from research, academia, and everyday commercial
practice, McConnell synthesizes the most effective techniques and must-know
principles into clear, pragmatic guidance. No matter what your experience level,
development environment, or project size, this book will inform and stimulate
your thinking—and help you build the highest quality code. Discover the timeless
techniques and strategies that help you: Design for minimum complexity and
maximum creativity Reap the benefits of collaborative development Apply
defensive programming techniques to reduce and flush out errors Exploit
opportunities to refactor—or evolve—code, and do it safely Use construction
practices that are right-weight for your project Debug problems quickly and
effectively Resolve critical construction issues early and correctly Build
quality into the beginning, middle, and end of your project.
