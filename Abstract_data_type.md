# Abstract data type (ADT)

> In [[Computer_science|computer_science]], an abstract data type (ADT) is a
> [[Mathematical_model|mathematical_model]] for [[Data_type|data_type]]. An abstract data type is
> defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user, of the
> data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of
> this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model
> contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data,
> and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.\
