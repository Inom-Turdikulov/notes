# Abstract syntax tree

> In [[Computer_science|computer_science]], an abstract syntax
> [[Tree|tree]] (AST), or just syntax tree, is a tree
> representation of the abstract ==syntactic structure of text== (often source
> code) written in a formal language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct
> occurring in the text.\
