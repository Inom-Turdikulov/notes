# Algorithm

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian
mathematician called 'Al-Khwārizmī' (he is practically from my **homeland**)
(Persian: خوارزمی, c. 780–850).

In general, it's, set of finite step-by-step instructions for solving some
problem ([[Logic|logical]] or [[Mathematics|mathematical]]), or to perform some
other **task** (for example something from real world, like
problem/computation). In other words a set of instructions for completing a
specific task.

Algorithm are used as specifications for performing computation and data
processing.

In computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by
a [[Turing_machine|Turing_machine]]. For the purpose of [[Computation|computing]], algorithms
are written in [[Pseudocode]], [[Flowchart]], or [[Programming_language|programming_language]].

Sometimes, it’s possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the
same task [[Computational_complexity]]. One algorithm can be faster than the
other by *orders of magnitude*.
