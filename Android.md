I use android on daily-basis with smartphone and tablet. But I'm trying to keep

I store list of useful software in [[My_awesome_software_list#Android|my software list]].

I also need sync data between my working machine and android devices. There 2
ways to sync data which I usually use:

1. Mount android device using `mounter` script, which assigned to `<MOD-C-m>` in
   [[DWM]]. And rsync data: `rsync -r <source> <destination>`.
2. Complex setup, using [[Syncthing]]
