# ArchiveBox

Self-hosted internet archiving solution. I tried to use it, but I found it a
little overcomplicated, and it's not solving some mine specific problems.

And I avoided using it, and instead I'm going to build my own archiving
solution, based on [[SingleFile_CLI_(software)|SingleFile CLI]],
[[Chromium|Chromium]] PDF printing and
[[Postlight_Parser_(software)|Postlight Parser]] based HTML DOM dump.
