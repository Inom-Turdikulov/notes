# Backend

Main difference between frontend and backend?
?
Fronted is data representation layer, backend is data access layer. And
this term includes not only software, but also hardware, physical
infrastructure, etc. Usually client is frontend and server is backend. Even
if some presentation work is done on server for example.
> In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend (sometimes
> written as back end or back-end) refer to the separation of concerns
> between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer
> (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or
> hardware. In the client–server model, the client is usually considered
> the frontend and the server are usually considered the backend, even when
> some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.\

I learn some fundamentals from [Backend Developer
Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend).
