# Binary search tree

> In [[Computer_science]], a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or
> sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of
> each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's
> left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree. The time complexity
> of operations on the binary search tree is directly proportional to the height
> of the tree.

A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the
principle of [[Binary_search_algorithm|binary_search]].

| --------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Algorithm | **Average** | **Worst case** |
| Space     | O(_n_)      | O(_n_)         |
| Search    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
| Insert    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
| Delete    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
