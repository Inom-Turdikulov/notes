# Brave (web browser)

Free open source browser.

Key features for me:

- Rich ad blocking (Shield), and it's available for all [[Computing_platform]]
  which I use.
- Support for extensions.
- [[Video_acceleration_API]] support on [[Linux]]
- [[Chrome_devtools]] support.
- Built-in browser sync, and it's available for all platforms which I use.
