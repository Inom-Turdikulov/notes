# C (programming language)

C is multi-paradigm programming language (I started learn it later than needed
ðŸ˜¼). By design work efficiently with typical machine instructions.

It\'s some like low-level programming language (but C is high-level and
general-purpose programming language). It's support functional/procedure
programming paradigm.

C common used in OS development, microcontroller firmware development,
databases, game development, utilities, etc.
