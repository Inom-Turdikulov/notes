# Chomsky hierarchy

> The Chomsky hierarchy, in the fields of formal language theory,
> [[Computer_science]], and linguistics, is a containment hierarchy of classes
> of formal grammars. This hierarchy of grammars was described by Noam Chomsky
> in 1956.

> The Chomsky hierarchy is a concept of theoretical computer science. Noam
> Chomsky looked at grammars of regular language and classified them into four
> levels, numbered 0 to 3 (4 groups, according to their **conditional
> complexity**).
>
> Group 0 consists of regular expressions without restriction, while groups 1 to
> 3 contain restrictions. Grammars in higher-numbered levels also satisfy the
> constraints of all levels below them.
