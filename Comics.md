# Comics

[[Media|medium]] used to express ideas with images, often
combined with text or other visual information. It typically takes the form of a
sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions,
and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other
information. There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a
definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some
sequentially or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as
mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters.
