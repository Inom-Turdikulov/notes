# Computer Science

Computer science connect theory (computation, automation, information) with real
world practice (software and hardware). In Russian, it's known as
**Информа́тика**.

In computer science central role plays [[Algorithm|algorithms]] and
[[Data_structure|data_structures]].

I think knowing computer science help to write effective [[Code]] (goal of good
[[Programmer|programmer]], which I want to be).

I described how I learn computer science here: [[How do I study computer
science]].
