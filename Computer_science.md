Computer science connect theory (computation, automation, information) with real
world practice (software and hardware). In Russian, it's known as Информа́тика.

Computer science closely related to
[[Computer_programming|computer programming]].

In computer science central role plays
==[[Algorithm|algorithms]] and [[Data_structure|data_structures]]==.

I think knowing computer science help to write effective [[Code|code]] (goal of
good [[Programmer|programmer]], which I want to be).

I described how I [[Learning|learn]] computer science
[[How_I_learn_computer_science|here]].
