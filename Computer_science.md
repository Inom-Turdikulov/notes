# Computer Science

> Study of [[Computation]], automation, and information. Computer
> [[Science]] spans theoretical disciplines (such as [[Algorithm|algorithms]],
> theory of computation, information theory, and automation) to practical
> disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and
> [[Computer_software|software]]). Computer science is generally considered an
> academic discipline and distinct from computer programming which is considered
> to be a technical field. [[Algorithm|Algorithms]] and [[Data_structure|data_structure]] are
> central to computer science.\

Computer science connect theory (computation, automation, information) with real
world practice (software and hardware). In Russian, it's known as
**Информа́тика**.

In computer science central role plays [[Algorithm|algorithms]] and
[[Data_structure|data_structures]].

I think knowing computer science help to write effective [[Code]] (goal of good
[[Programmer|programmer]], which I want to be).

I described how I learn computer science here: [[How do I study computer
science]].
