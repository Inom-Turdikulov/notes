I think knowing computer science help to write effective [[Code|code]] (goal of
good [[Programmer|programmer]], which I want to be). I described how I
[[Learning|learn]] computer science [[How_I_learn_computer_science|here]].

Computer science connect theory (computation, automation, information) with real
world practice (software and hardware). In Russian, it's known as Информа́тика.

Computer science closely related to
[[Computer_programming|computer programming]].

In computer science central role plays
==[[Algorithm|algorithms]] and [[Data_structure|data_structures]]==.

The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general
classes of problems that can be solved using them.

The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for
secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities.

Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images.

Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational
processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data.

Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and
computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and
principles behind developing software.

Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the
principles and design behind complex systems.

Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and
computer-operated equipment.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated
processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation,
planning and learning found in humans and animals.

Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process
image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and
process textual and linguistic data.

The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot
be automated. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest
distinction in computer science.
