_Pozharsky cutlet_

## Cuisines of Russia, Ukraine and other countries of former Soviet Union

> In modern Russian, the word kotleta (котлета) refers almost exclusively to
> pan-fried minced meat croquettes / cutlet-shaped patties. Bread soaked in
> milk, onions, garlic, and herbs is usually present in the recipe. When in a
> hurry, a "cutlet" can be eaten between bread slices like a hamburger, but this
> fast meal is rarely served in restaurants. It is usually served with pan-fried
> potatoes, mashed potatoes, pasta, etc.
>
> A particular form of the Russian `kotleta` known as Pozharsky cutlet is an
> elaborated version of minced poultry kotleta covered with breadcrumbs or small
> croutons. A distinct feature of this cutlet is that butter is added to minced
> meat, which results in an especially juicy and tender consistency.
>
> Another Russian version of a cutlet, called otbivnaya kotleta (отбивная
> котлета), meaning "beaten cutlet", is a fried slice of meat, usually pork or
> beef, beaten flat with a tenderizing hammer or knife handle and covered with
> beaten eggs, dough or breadcrumbs. The recipe is similar to those of
> escalopes, schnitzel, Polish, or American cutlets. Today, this dish is simply
> called otbivnaya, with the word kotleta reserved for minced meat patties.
>
> Chicken Kiev is called kotleta po-kievski (котлета по-киевски) in Russian and
> similarly kotleta po-kyivski (котлета по-київськи) in Ukrainian, which means
> "Kiev-style cutlet".\
