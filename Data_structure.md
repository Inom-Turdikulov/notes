# Data structures

> In [[Computer_science|computer science]], a data structure is a data
> organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for
> efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of
> data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations
> that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about
> data.\

Analyzing the number of steps an operation takes is the heart of understanding
the performance of data structures. Choose right data structure can greatly
impact on performance of your program.

Data itself is just basically numbers and strings (in computers all data finally
stored as [[Bit|bit]] sequences).

Basic data structure is [[Array|array]].

- [ ] imperative and functional versions
- [ ] greedy
- [ ] dynamic strategies
- [ ] directed and undirected graphs

Data structures refer to ==how== data is organized. But data organization can be
highly impact on **performance**. Your program can run fast and efficient or
even not run at all (out of memory as example).

Depending on data organization program can run faster
or slower by orders of **magnitude**.

So solid knowledge in data structures allows you to write scalable, fast and
efficient software, increase your software expertise and make you happy ðŸ™‚.

## Data structure operations

Which data structure operations are important?
?
Here is a list of the most common operations and how they can be used with an
array.
- Read, lookup a value in array at a particular index.
- Search, if value exist in array, return index.
- Insert, add new value to additional slot within array.
- Delete, remove value from array.
