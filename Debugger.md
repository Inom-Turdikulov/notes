# Debugger

> A debugger or debugging tool is a [[Computer_program|computer program]] used
> to [[Software_testing|test]] and debug other programs (the "target" program).
> The main use of a debugger is to run the target program under
> ==controlled conditions== that permit the programmer to track its execution
> and monitor changes in computer resources that may indicate malfunctioning
> code. Typical debugging facilities include the ability to run or halt the
> target program at specific points, display the contents of memory, CPU
> registers or storage devices (such as disk drives), and modify memory or
> register contents in order to enter selected test data that might be a cause
> of faulty program
> execution.\
