# Dictionary

> A dictionary is a listing of lexemes from the lexicon of one or more specific
> languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by consonantal root for Semitic
> languages or radical and stroke for logographic languages), which may include
> information on definitions, usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation,
> etc. It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships
> among the data.\
