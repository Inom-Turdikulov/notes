# Education

Related lists:

- [[My_read_books]].
- [[Articles]].

TODO: check/move books/articles into now or maybe archive.

Since I'm use [[Zettelkasten]], I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources, my experience, etc. That
materials have `research` tag.

To study effectively I use [[SQ3R_method]], [[How_to_study|study techniques]]
and various [[research/Polya-How_to_solve_it|methods]].

It's not enough to study only, need continuously practice (use your knowledge)
and test yourself, to solve this problem I use [[Spaced_repetition|spaced
repetition]] and implement my [[My_pet_projects|pet projects]] and
[[Work|working projects]].

> The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.\

I think [[research/Polya-How_to_solve_it|how to solve it]] can be also used
as method to learn.
