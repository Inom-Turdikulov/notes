# Electronic design automation (EDA)

> Electronic design automation (EDA), also referred to as electronic
> computer-aided design (ECAD), is a category of
> [[My_awesome_software_list#eda|software_tools]] for designing electronic
> systems such as integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. The tools work
> together in a design flow that chip designers use to design and analyze entire
> semiconductor chips. Since a modern semiconductor chip can have billions of
> components, EDA tools are essential for their design; this article in
> particular describes EDA specifically with respect to integrated circuits
> (ICs).\
