# FFmpeg - A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.

> FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
> mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
> machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
> cutting edge. No matter if they were designed by some standards committee, the
> community or a corporation. It is also highly portable: FFmpeg compiles, runs,
> and passes our testing infrastructure FATE across Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft
> Windows, the BSDs, Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build environments,
> machine architectures, and configurations.

I widely use FFmpeg in various wrappres and sometimes directly. Best example is
slightly modified [Luke Smith's](https://lukesmith.xyz/)
[ffmpeg screen record script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/master/.local/bin/dmenurecord).

TODO: place my version here.
