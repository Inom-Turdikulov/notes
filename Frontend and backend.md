# Front-end web development

> In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend (sometimes written as
> back end or back-end) refer to the separation of concerns between the
> presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece
> of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. In the client–server
> model, the client is usually considered the frontend and the server are
> usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually
> done on the server itself.\
