# Game

> A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or
> **fun**, and sometimes used as an **educational tool**. Many games are also
> considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or
> games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout
> such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).\
