> (gê) 'earth, land', and μέτρον (métron) 'a measure') is a branch of
> [[Mathematics|mathematics]] concerned with properties of space such as the
> distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. Geometry is, along
> with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. A mathematician
> who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. Until the 19th
> century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry,[a]
> which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface,
> and curve, as fundamental concepts.
