# Getting Things Done (GTD)

I like ideas of GTD productivity system. I not read the book, but I use daily
GTD method.

General ideas:
- Inbox
- Next actions
- Waiting for
- Projects
- Some day/maybe

## Inbox

Inbox is where you can QUICK as possible add all your tasks, ideas, etc...
Using Taskwarrior I can add task through special scratch window, bind to
<kbd>s-grave</kbd> keybinding.

`next`, task which you can do now (or anytime). If you're not planning do this
task, you need to move them into `wailt` list or `someday` list.

`wait`, task which you can't do now, but you need to do it in the future.
Taskwarrior allow hide this tasks from `next` list, but you can see them by
using `task list all`.
