Old game, I think first played it somewhere in 2005-2006 with my brother. But I
mostly watched him (as usual). Maybe I used some cheats (`b->marvin->b`).

I want to play it again, but this time in "right way". My initial point is
watching video guide, to understand basic controls:

Full game controls available at [[Gothic_controls|controls]] note.
