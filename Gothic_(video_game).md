Old game, I think first played it somewhere in 2005-2006 with my brother. But I
mostly watched him (as usual). Maybe I used some cheats (`b->marvin->b`).

I want to play it again, but this time in "right way". My initial point is
watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpRlGYwSL-8) video, to
understand basic controls.
