> -   When picking a lock, hold down USE throughout the lockpicking process. You'll need a [Picklock](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Miscellaneous#ITKELOCKPICK "Gothic/Miscellaneous"). If both left and right fail, the lock can't be picked and you need a [key](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Miscellaneous#Keys "Gothic/Miscellaneous").
> -   To select items to equip, open your inventory Tab and use ← → to browse the categories. [Weapons](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Weapons "Gothic/Weapons"), [magic](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Magic "Gothic/Magic") and [artifacts](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Artifacts "Gothic/Artifacts") can be equipped with Mod**+** W . To un-equip an item, press Ctrl**+** W again.
> -   [Writings](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Writings "Gothic/Writings"), [food](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Food "Gothic/Food"), [potions](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Potions "Gothic/Potions"), [torches](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Miscellaneous#ITLSTORCH "Gothic/Miscellaneous"), [joints](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Miscellaneous#Other_items "Gothic/Miscellaneous") and the [Lute](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Miscellaneous#ITMILUTE "Gothic/Miscellaneous") can be read/consumed/used with Mod**+** W . The torch can be put away again with Ctrl**+** W , but you need to have at least two torches in your inventory to do that.
> -   To punch, assume fighting stance first with ~. To attack or parry with a melee weapon, equip your weapon first with 1. To fire an arrow, equip your bow first with 2. To cast spells, equip the magic spell first using 3 through 9 and 0.
> -   The process when dealing with looting chests, defeated foes or [merchants](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Merchants "Gothic/Merchants") is mostly the same. To move through categories, press ← → without the USE key. The only difference with merchants is that you move items from the merchant (left) and items from your inventory (right) to the middle of the screen until you're happy with the exchange and the value you offer equals or exceeds the value of the goods from the merchant, then press Enter to finalize the deal.
>
> When using weapons, there is a form of automatic lock-on. Not to make an action game easier for console players (Gothic was never released for any console), but because Gothic _isn't_ an "action" game, at least, not of that kind. Gothic is not like an FPS that tests your reflexes, it's more like [Dungeons & Dragons](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Game_mechanics#You_were_secretly_playing_Dungeons_&_Dragons "Gothic/Game mechanics"), or more accurately, a hybrid between the two. This style also heavily contributes to the game being easy to play without a mouse.
>
> Have a fiddle with the settings in the game and get a feel for whatever works for you. Jump only works when either moving and pressing jump or if you are standing against a wall/cliff and press  W  at the same time. If you want to climb something, stand close to it and hold down the jump button Alt. The camera angle will now change, as if the protagonist is looking up. If you now press  W  once, you will hang off the ledge. If you press  W  again (or held it down), you will climb onto it. If the slope is less than (say) 80°, you may not be able to grab it even if it looks like it'd be a cakewalk.
>
> If you'd rather play using a gamepad, you can use a third-party utility such as Joy2Key (don't confuse the Linux and Windows versions, as they are different programs with the same name, though they share a similar purpose) to map the gamepad controls to keyboard key presses. This works pretty well, as there are only about a dozen important controls in the game in total.
>
> In any case, be careful, as certain key combinations (such as Mod**+**Esc) may cause the game to crash if accidentally pressed.
