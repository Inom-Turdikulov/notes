# Graph theory

> In [[Mathematics|mathematics]], graph theory is the study of [[Graph|graphs]],
> which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between
> objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or
> points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A
> distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices
> symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices
> asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete
> mathematics.\
