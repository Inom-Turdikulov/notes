# Handwriting

> Handwriting is the writing done with a **writing instrument**, such as a pen or
> pencil, in the hand. Handwriting includes both printing and cursive styles and
> is separate from formal calligraphy or typeface. Because each person's
> handwriting is unique and different, it can be used to verify a document's
> writer. The deterioration of a person's handwriting is also a symptom or
> result of several different diseases. The inability to produce clear and
> coherent handwriting is also known as dysgraphia.\

I like to write beautiful and readable handwriting, but I preffer more
calligraphy style.
