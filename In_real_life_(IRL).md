# In real life (IRL)

IRL is abbreviation for "in real life". I use it to describe my real life
activities.

For life support I need [[My_buy_list|buy_some_things]], [[Cooking|cook]] food
and [[My_inventory|keep_inventory]].

Sometimes I do some [[Do_it_yourself|cool_things]] or spent time for [[Art]].

Also, worth to mention this notes [[Home_construction]] and [[Government]].
