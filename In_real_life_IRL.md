# In real life (IRL)

IRL is abbreviation for "in real life". I use it to describe my real life
activities.

For life support I need [[My_buy_list|buy some things]], [[Cooking|cook]] food
and [[My_inventory|keep inventory]] (which require [[Maintenance|maintenance]]).

Sometimes I do some [[Do_it_yourself_DIY|cool things]] or spent time for [[Art|art]].

Also, worth to mention this notes [[Home_construction|home construction]] and
[[Government|goverment]].
