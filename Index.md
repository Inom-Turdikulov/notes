# Inom's daily notes

I keep my notes, mostly to improve my [[Education|education]] process, store
important information (for me) and share it with others.

My initial and most visited not is [[Now]]. Here I store my current activities
and past activities, also I'm trying to keep it up to date. I need constantly
check and update this page, because all things are changing, and I need to track
my progress.

## IRL notes

[[Work]] is very important part of my life, it's allow keep my
[[Finance|finance]] budget stable, live actively and interesting.

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages and
[[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]]. I also store my
[[How_do_I_work_with_contacts|contacts]] workflow.

[[Style_of_life|My style of life]] currently still chaotic, but I'm trying to
organize it. These notes are help me to do it.

Mentoring, I don't think I'm great at this, but I'm trying to help people on
[[GitHub]] projects, and in future on [[Stack_Overflow]]. Sometimes on different
platforms or IRL.

## Relax and fun

I can also spend time with my family, friends and pets or consume some media,
for example:

- Watching [[My_Movies|movies]], [[Twitch]], [[YouTube]]
- Playing [[My_Games|games]], mostly video games
- Reading [[My_read_books|books]] and [[News|news]]
- Listening [[My_Music|music]]
- Improve my [[My_art|art]] skills

And of course healthy [[Sleep|sleep]].
