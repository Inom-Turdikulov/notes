# Instruction_cycle

> The instruction cycle (also known as the fetch–decode–execute cycle, or simply
> the fetch-execute cycle) is the cycle that the central processing unit (CPU)
> follows from boot-up until the [[Computer|computer ]] has shut down in order
> to process instructions. It is composed of three main stages:
> 1. The fetch stage
> 2. The decode stage
> 3. The execute stage\
