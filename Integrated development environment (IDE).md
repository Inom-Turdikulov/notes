# Integrated development environment (IDE)

> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that
> provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software
> development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build
> automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse,
> contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; others, such as
> SharpDevelop and Lazarus, do not.
