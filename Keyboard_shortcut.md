# Keyboard shortcut

> In [[Computing|computing]], a keyboard shortcut also known as hotkey is a
> series of one or several keys to quickly invoke a software program or perform
> a preprogrammed action. This action may be part of the standard functionality
> of the operating system or application program, or it may have been written by
> the user in a scripting language. Some integrated keyboards also include
> pointing devices; the definition of exactly what counts as a "key" sometimes
> differs.\
