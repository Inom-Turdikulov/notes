# Learning

Important place in choosing what to learn is my [[Work#Goals|work goals]]
and my [[My_pet_projects|pet projects]] required skills.

Since I'm use [[Zettelkasten]], I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources, my experience, etc. That
materials have `research` tag.

My current focus is on following things, order is not important. All with help
of [[Spaced_repetition|spaced repetition]], [[SQ3R_method|Sq3R]],
[[Zettelkasten|zettelkasten]], [[How_to_study_or_learn|study techniques]], etc.

It's not enough to study only, need continuously practice (use your knowledge)
and test yourself, to solve this problem I implement my [[My_pet_projects|pet
projects]] and [[Work|working projects]] to strengthen my studies.

Generally I want to focus on 2 parts of my education:


## Fundamentals of science

### Theory (priority is matter)

**[[Computer_science|Computer science]]** combination of many science fields.
My [[How_I_learn_computer_science|learning path]].

**[[Computer_graphics|Computer graphics]]** I very impressed by it, and I like
to learn more about it. My [[How_I_learn_computer_graphics|learning path]].

**[[Art]]** is a great way to express my thoughts in easy to understand form.
Art for me is also deeply integrated into computer graphics, because it provides
many opportunities to create something beautiful.
My [[How_I_learn_art|learning path]].

**[[Mathematics]]** is a fundamental science, and part of many others, and I
want to learn it better, at least on some beginner/advanced level.
My [[How_I_learn_mathematics|learning path]].

**[[Physics]]** and **[[Chemistry]]** go after mathematics in my learning
priority. I want to understand world better, and this fields can help me with
it. My [[How_I_learn_physics_and_chemistry|learning path]].

**[[History]]** and **[[Literature]]**, many works in literature are related to
history. Knowing history is improving your understanding of current world.
Literature for me is great solution to fun and relax. My
[[My_fiction_books|read and to read books]].
TODO: add history/literature learning path note.

**[[English_language|English language]]** is great to reveal huge part of
world, new knowledge and opportunities. My
[[How_I_learn_English_language|learning plan]].

**[[Health]]** required for all humans, and I want to learn how to be healthy
and more important how to stay healthy. I have
[[My_Physical_exercise_plan|exercise plan]], which I follow.

### Practice

- [[My_pet_projects|My pet projects]]
- [[LeetCode]]
- [PhET simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/)
- [[My_sketchbook|My sketchbook]]
- [[My_Physical_exercise_plan|My physical exercise plan]]

## Programming and software development

### Theory

**[[How_I_learn_programming_and_software_development|Programming and software development]]**
This is place where I store programming applied learning materials, related
outline notes (like frontend/backend) and some management stuff.

**My editing workflow** is heavily related to [[Neovim]], but it can be
replicated in some advanced code editor (like [[Pycharm]]), here I store my main
editing practices, tricks, etc.

**[[My_productivity_workflow|My productivity workflow]]** is about how I manage
my time, tasks, etc. It's not only about software development, but also about my life.

**[[My_awesome_software_list|My awesome software list]]** is subset of endlessly
large software list, which I use for my work and personal life.

### Practice
