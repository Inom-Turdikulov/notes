# Maintenance

> Functional checks, servicing, repairing or replacing of necessary devices,
> equipment, machinery, building infrastructure, and supporting utilities in
> industrial, business, and residential installations. Over time, this has come
> to include multiple wordings that describe various cost-effective practices to
> keep equipment operational; these activities occur either before or after a
> failure.
>
> Any activity—such as tests, measurements, replacements, adjustments, and
> repairs—intended to retain or restore a functional unit in or to a specified
> state in which the unit can perform its required functions.
>
> All action taken to retain material in a serviceable condition or to restore
> it to serviceability. It includes inspections, testing, servicing,
> classification as to serviceability, repair, rebuilding, and reclamation.
>
> All supply and repair action taken to keep a force in condition to carry out
> its mission.
>
> The routine recurring work required to keep a facility (plant, building,
> structure, ground facility, utility system, or other real property) in such
> condition that it may be continuously used, at its original or designed
> capacity and efficiency for its intended purpose.\

I like term Negentropy, which can describe my maintenance process.

> Negentropy is reverse entropy. It means things becoming more in order. By
> 'order' is meant organization, structure and function: the opposite of
> randomness or chaos. One example of negentropy is a star system such as the
> Solar System. Another example is life.\

I store tasks, which I need to check constantly, in this file. This helps me to
reduce chaos in my life (at least digital), I also collect all my techniques and
tools information in this note.

- Maintenance downloads (remove old files, etc...)
- Maintenance [[My_backup_plan|backups]] (weekly check)

## Inbox

Here I collect various inbox directories and services, which I need to check
regularly. Main goal is get rid of entropy and use only 3 inboxes. But currently
it's what I have:

- [ ] validate how much data writing daily

- Calendar events
- Contacts
- Emails (all my inboxes)
- Passwords
- SSH/GPG keys

- Videos and pictures workflow
- Optimize /etc/dotfiles
- Optimize configurations NOT stored in /etc/dotfiles (very few)
- Organize files in $HOME
- Flash cards optimization/review
- History clean
- Mobile device backup
- Sync dotfiles, nvim config and check it
- Review search engines
- Firefox profiles settings (about:config), at least `browser.sessionstore.interval`
- docker system prune; docker volume prune (be careful with this, backup
DB/important, keep running important containers)
- GitHub and YouTube likes, subscriptions
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Yandex Disk, etc...)
- Review [[Dataview_maintenance_queries|dataview]] note.
- Telegram saved messages, need to replace with something else. Can be replaced
with Firefox bookmarks.
- [[Firefox]] bookmarks (mobile/desktop).
- Cloud storage directories (need to do initial clean).
- Downloads directory (mobile/desktop/tablet).
- My old literature inbox: `~/Arts_and_Entertainment/literature/inbox/` need to
clean-up.
- Audio notes (mobile/tablet). Maybe I find some plugin in obsidian, which
support audio to text conversion or build some workflow.
- RNR tasks in [[Taskwarrior|taskwarrior]] and `project:inbox` tasks. Handled by
taskwarrior CLI.
- [[How_do_I_sync_my_data|Sync my data]].

## Wiki

- [[Dataview_maintenance_queries|Dataview maintenance]], maintenance my
[[Zettelkasten]] system.
- Wiki inbox directory.
- Find broken links in Wiki, find broken symlinks
- `rg --files-with-matches -U tags\:\\n-|xargs vi`, find incorrect formatting
tags

## Hardware & Monitoring

- [ ] base monitoring setup
- [ ] how inform about problems? (email, telegram, etc...)
- [ ] backup monitoring setup
- [ ] better arch maintenance script, add `iotop`?
