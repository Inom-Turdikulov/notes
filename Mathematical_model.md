# Mathematical model

> A [[Mathematics|mathematical]] model is an abstract description of a
> concrete system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of
> developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling.
>
> Mathematical models are used in applied mathematics and in the natural
> [[Science]]s (such as [[Physics]], biology, earth science, chemistry) and
> engineering disciplines (such as [[Computer_science]], electrical
> engineering), as well as in non-physical systems such as the social
> sciences (such as economics, [[Psychology]], sociology, political
> science). It can also be taught as a subject in its own right.\
