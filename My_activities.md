# My daily activities and goals

This page contains actual lists of things I'm doing [[Now]] (daily activities),
long term goals and some other things. I need constantly check and update this
page, because all things are changing.

This page is a part of my [[Zettelkasten]].

## Work and long-term projects

This is very important part of my life, it's allow keep my [[Finance]] stable,
live actively and interesting. I'm working now as a software engineer in a small
company (remote, full-stack position, but moving into
[[My_backend_developer_roadmap|backend]] position).

I organize my work using, [[Getting_things_done_GTD|GTD]] mainly using Inbox,
Tasks (TODO and NEXT), Daily and Weekly notes with [[Taskwarrior]].

To follow external timelines I sometimes use [[Calendar]] events, but
it's secondary task planner.

To connect with colleagues I use [[Instant_messaging|IM]] and [[Email]] clients.

In my work significantly help my [[Development_Environment]], [[Backup]]
plan and daily [[Maintenance]], with attention to [[Computer_security]] practices.

Currently, I'm working on social platform automation project.

## Social activity and family

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages. Here is
[[How_do_I_work_with_contacts|contacts]] if you need to write something to me.

## Exercise and health

Right now I'm trying to follow my personal
[[research/Exercise_plan|exercise plan]] and [[My_everyday_life|routine]].

## Relax and fun

I can also spend time with my family, friends and pets or consume some media,
for example:

- Watching [[My_Movies]], [[Twitch|twitch]],
  [[Youtube|youtube]]
- Playing [[My_Games]]
- Reading [[My_read_books]] and [[News]]
- Listening [[My_Music]]
- Art [[My_art]]

And of course healthy [[Sleep]].

## Education and self-development

I'm trying to learn new things every day. Currently, I'm studying (this is
plan):

Here my "to learn" books list: [[My_read_books]].

Here my "to learn" articles list: [[My_articles_list]].

TODO: check/move books/articles into now or maybe archive.

Since I'm use [[Zettelkasten]], I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources, my experience, etc.

To study effectively I use [[Sq3R_method]], [[How_to_study|study techniques]]
and various [[How_to_solve_it|methods ]]. More information is [[Education|here]].

It's not enough to study only, need continuously practice (use your knowledge)
and test yourself, to solve this problem I use [[Spaced_repetition]] and
implement my [[My_pet_projects|pet_projects]] and
[[Work|working projects]].

## Society

Check this note [[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]].

## Mentoring and helping

I don't think I'm great at this, but I'm trying to help people on [[GitHub|GitHub]],
and in future on [[Stack_Overflow]]. Sometimes on different platforms or IRL.
