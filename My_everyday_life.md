# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

## 1. Wake-up

Initialization, want to do good wake-up, care about my body, warm-up and walk.
Wake-up with good moon, make your day better.


Good checklist for wake-up:
- [ ] Take a shower or bath
- [ ] Wash your face and brush your teeth
- [ ] Drink a glass of water
- [ ] Place phone, headphones, tablet on charger
- [ ] Do basic training, 20–35 minutes sessions

## 2. Project A chunk 1

Main goals:
- [ ] Opportunity to **work hard**.
