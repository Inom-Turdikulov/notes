# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

## Take care of yourself

1. Brushing Teeth, twice daily:

- Wet the toothbrush and apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.
- Brush teeth in a circular motion for 2 minutes, covering all surfaces.
- Use a toothbrush with soft bristles to avoid damaging the gums.
- Rinse mouth thoroughly with water after brushing.
- Floss between teeth to remove food particles and plaque.
- Rinse with mouthwash for fresh breath and added protection against cavities.

2. Shaving, as needed:

- Wet the face with warm water to soften the hair.
- Apply shaving cream or gel to the face.
- Use a sharp razor to shave in the direction of hair growth.
- Rinse the razor frequently to remove hair and shaving cream.
- Rinse the face with cool water and pat dry.
- Apply aftershave or moisturizer to soothe the skin.

3. Manicure, every 2 weeks:

- Trim nails to desired length using nail clippers.
- Use a nail file to shape the nails and smooth any rough edges.
- Soak hands in warm, soapy water to soften the cuticles.
- Gently push back cuticles using a cuticle pusher or orangewood stick.
- Moisturize hands and nails with hand cream or cuticle oil.
- Apply nail polish if desired.

4. Washing Head (Hair), 2–3 times per week:

- Wet hair thoroughly with warm water.
- Apply a small amount of shampoo to the scalp and massage gently to lather.
- Rinse hair thoroughly with warm water until all shampoo is removed.
- Apply conditioner from mid-length to the ends of the hair.
- Leave conditioner on for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly with cool water.
- Gently towel dry hair and style as desired.

5. Haircut, every 4–6 weeks:

- Visit a professional hair salon or barber shop.
- Communicate desired haircut style with the stylist or barber.
- Sit comfortably and allow the stylist or barber to trim and style your hair.
- Optionally, request additional services such as hair coloring or treatments.
- Pay attention to hygiene practices at the salon, ensuring clean tools and
  equipment are used.

## Chunk #1. Wake-up

Initialization, want to do good wake-up, care about my body, warm-up and walk.
Wake-up with good moon, make your day better. I feel better if I wake up from
7:30 to 8:00 am.

Good checklist for wake-up:

- Wash your face and brush your teeth.
- Drink a glass of water.
- Do basic training, 20–35 minutes sessions.
- Walk outside for 10–20 minutes.
- Prepare your workspace and yourself.

## Chunk #2. Working/Project, aka Crank Session

Schedule, disable distractions, prepare water breath deeply and start working.

Main goals:

- Reduce distractions, let know everyone you will be busy.
- Focus on main tasks, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks and working session.
- Take at least one break in this working session.
- Drink more water.

## Chunk #3. Lunch and long break

You can prepare your lunch in the morning or in the evening. Give rest to your
eyes and mind and fuel your body and give time to food digestion.

## Chunk #4. Finish Working/Project

Complete main tasks, connect with people, help them. Mark completed tasks. And
give you time to learn something new.

## Chunk #5. Relax and Exercise a little bit

Regular work-out for better energy and healthy mind. Better to do it according
[[My_Physical_exercise_plan|plan]] and track your progress.

## Chunk #6. LEARN, IRL, pet projects, fun

Good time to learn and practice learned information by working with
[[My_pet_projects|pet projects]], relax, do everyday tasks and have fun.

Be helpful but don't forget about yourself and your family.

## Chunk #7. Planning

- Plan your day, week, month, year, life.
- Check your [[Work#Goals|goals]], expertness, health, family and calendar.
- Place E-devices on charger.

## Chunk #8. Rest

Rest, to be ready for tomorrow, don't try to make longer your day. Try to start
sleep maximum at 00:00 am. Take a shower, drink something (glass of water or
something else). Read a book or do something relaxing.
