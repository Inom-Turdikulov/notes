# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

## Chunk #1. Wake-up

Initialization, want to do good wake-up, care about my body, warm-up and walk.
Wake-up with good moon, make your day better. I feel better if I wake up from
7:30 to 8:00 am.

Good checklist for wake-up:

- Wash your face and brush your teeth.
- Drink a glass of water.
- Do basic training, 20–35 minutes sessions.
- Walk outside for 10–20 minutes.
- Prepare your workspace and yourself.

## Chunk #2. Working/Project, aka Crank Session

Schedule, disable distractions, prepare water breath deeply and start working.

Main goals:

- Reduce distractions, let know everyone you will be busy.
- Focus on main tasks, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks and working session.
- Take at least one break in this working session.
- Drink more water.

## Chunk #3. Lunch and long break

You can prepare your lunch in the morning or in the evening. Give rest to your
eyes and mind and fuel your body and give time to food digestion.

## Chunk #4. Finish Working/Project

Complete main tasks, connect with people, help them. Mark completed tasks.
And give you time to learn something new.

## Chunk #5. Relax and Exercise a little bit

Regular work-out for better energy and healthy mind. Better to do it according
[[My_Physical_exercise_plan|plan]] and track your progress.

## Chunk #6. LEARN, IRL, pet projects, fun

Good time to learn and practice learned information by working with
[[My_pet_projects|pet projects]], relax, do everyday tasks and have fun.

Be helpful but don't forget about yourself and your family.

## Chunk #7. Planning

- Plan your day, week, month, year, life.
- Check your [[Work#Goals|goals]], expertness, health, family and calendar.
- Place E-devices on charger.

## Chunk #8. Rest

Rest, to be ready for tomorrow, don't try to make longer your day. Try to start
sleep maximum at 00:00 am. Take a shower, drink something (glass of water or
something else). Read a book or do something relaxing.
