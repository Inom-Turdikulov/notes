# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

## 1. Wake-up

Initialization, want to do good wake-up, care about my body, warm-up and walk.
Wake-up with good moon, make your day better. I feel better if I wake up from
9:00 to 10:00 am.

Good checklist for wake-up:

- Wash your face and brush your teeth.
- Drink a glass of water.
- Do basic training, 20â€“35 minutes sessions.
- Prepare your workspace and yourself.

## 2. Working chunk 1, aka Crank Session

Main goals:

- Reduce distractions.
- Focus on main tasks, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks and working session.
- Take at least one break in this working session.
- Drink more water.

## 3. Lunch and long break

You can prepare your lunch in the morning or in the evening. Give rest to your
eyes and mind and fuel your body.

## 4. Working chunk 2

Complete main tasks, connect with people, help them. Mark completed tasks.

## 5. Walk/Exercise

Regular work-out for better energy and healthy mind. Better to do it according
[[research/My_Physical_exercise_plan|plan]] and track your progress.

## 6. Relax/Dinner

Relax, have fun, eat healthy food.

## 7. Education

Need to learn something new, to grow it's important.

## 8. [[My_pet_projects|Pet projects]]

Opportunity for side projects, to improve your skills. Do something
fun/interesting/creative.

## 10. IRL

Be helpful but don't forget about yourself and your family.

## 11. Planning

- Plan your day, week, month, year, life.
- Check your [[Work#Goals|goals]], expertness, health, family and calendar.
- Place E-devices on charger.

## 12. Rest

Rest, to be ready for tomorrow, don't try to make longer your day. Try to start
sleep maximum at 00:00 am.
