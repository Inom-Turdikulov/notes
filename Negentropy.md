# Negentropy

> Negentropy is reverse entropy. It means things becoming more in order. By
> 'order' is meant organization, structure and function: the opposite of
> randomness or chaos. One example of negentropy is a star system such as the
> Solar System. Another example is life.\

I store tasks, which I need to check constantly, in this file. This helps me to
