# Now

This note help me build my daily plan and track what I'm doing, completed items
are moved into archive section.

## Global activities

1. [[My_routine|Routine]]. Goals are to keep my mood predictable and stable. I
   failed multiple times to keep it, but I'm still trying.
2. [[Work]]. Doing for living and for fun (ideally). This is complicated process
   which deeply integrated with all aspects of my life.
3. [[Learning]]. To keep my knowledge and skills up to date. I'm trying to learn
   something new every day, according to specific **goals** and plan.
4. [[My_pet_projects|Pet Projects]]. Pet projects can be used to show results of
   my education and something which I like to do.
5. [[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]]. Since human are inherently social creatures, I
   should maintain some social connections and interact with other people, solve
   household tasks and so on.
