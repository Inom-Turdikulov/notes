# Now

This note help me build my daily plan and track what I'm doing, completed items
are moved into archive section. [[Taskwarrior]] with
[[Getting_things_done_GTD|GTD]] helps me to manage my tasks and projects.
Check related `# Now` section in my notes for more details.

I have some global tasks, which allow choosing what to do next:

- [[Work]] as main activity, which I'm doing for living and for fun (ideally).
  Check it for global tasks and projects first.
- [[My_routine|Daily routine]], for more predictable life, if you haven't own
  routine someone's else will give you one.
- [[Learning]], for inspiration and self-improvement, source of pet projects
- [[My_pet_projects|Pet Projects]] to do something interesting and useful, also
  this is useful to practice what I learn.
- [[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]] for social activities and socializing.
- [[My_Physical_exercise_plan|physical exercises]] to increase quality of life.
