# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

> Way of writing computer programs using "objects" to stand for data and
> methods. Often, computer programs that are not object-oriented are a list of
> instructions for the computer, telling it to do certain things in a certain
> way.\

Be careful, OOP can produce a lot of boilerplate code. It's not always the best
solution.

## SOLID principles, to make object-oriented designs better

The SOLID ideas are:

- The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one
reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only
one responsibility.

- The Open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for
extension, but closed for modification."

- The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references
to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing
it." See also design by contract.

- The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend
upon interfaces that they do not use."

- The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."

The SOLID acronym was introduced later, around 2004, by Michael Feathers.

Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also
form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive
software development.
