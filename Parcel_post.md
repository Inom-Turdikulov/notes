# Parcel post

> Parcel post is a postal service for mail that is too heavy for normal letter
> post. It is usually slower than letter post. The development of the parcel
> post is closely connected with the development of the railway network which
> enabled parcels to be carried in bulk, to a regular schedule and at economic
> prices. Today, many parcels also travel by road and international shipments
> may travel by sea or airmail.

I use it very often in my [[In_real_life_IRL|life]].
