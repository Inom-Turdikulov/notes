# Photography

> Photography is the [[Art|art]], application, and practice of creating durable
> images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor,
> or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic
> film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g.,
> photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film
> and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.\
