# Portable Document Format (PDF)

> File format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text
> formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software,
> hardware, and operating systems. Based on the PostScript language, each PDF
> file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document,
> including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other
> information needed to display it.
