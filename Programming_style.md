# Programming style

> Programming style, also known as [[Code|code]] style, is a set of rules or
> guidelines used when writing the source code for a
> [[Computer_program|computer program]]. It is often claimed that following a
> particular programming style will help [[Programmer|programmers]] read and
> understand [[Source_code|source code]] conforming to the style, and help to
> avoid introducing errors.\
>
> A classic work on the subject was
> [[research/Kernighan_and_Plauger-The_Elements_of_Programming_Style|The Elements of Programming Style]]
> , written in the 1970s, and illustrated with examples from the Fortran and
> PL/I languages prevalent at the time.

My first experience with code style was while I learned basics of web
development and I mainly checked [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).

The elements of programming style are next what I will read.
TODO: check in the future, did I read it?
