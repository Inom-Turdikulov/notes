[[Zen_of_python]] describes the philosophy of Python.

This is most prioritized language for me. I learn it according to my
[[My_python_developer_roadmap]].

**Python** [@PythonProgrammingLanguage2023] is a
[[High-level_programming_language|high-level]],
[[General-purpose_programming_language]].

One of key features of Python is attention to [[Readability]], by using
indentation to delimit code blocks, rather than curly brackets or keywords.

Python is [dynamically typed] and [garbage-collected].

It supports any popular [[Programming_paradigm]]:

- [[Structured_programming]]
- [[Procedural_programming]]
- [[Object-oriented_programming]]
- [[Functional_programming]]

Rich [[Python_standard_library|standard_library]] make it's "batteries
included" language.
