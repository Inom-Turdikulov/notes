# My [[Zettelkasten]] notes.

I keep my notes, mostly to improve my [[Learning|education]] process, store
important information (for me) and share it with others.

## Now activities

To build my daily plan and track what I'm doing I use [[Taskwarrior]] with
[[Getting_things_done_GTD|GTD]] metodology, this helps me to manage my tasks and
projects.

I have some global tasks, which allow choosing what to do next:

- [[My_routine|Daily routine]], for more predictable life, if you haven't own
  routine someone's else will give you one.
- [[Work]] as main activity, which I'm doing for living and for fun (ideally).
  Check it for global tasks and projects first.
- [[Learning]], for inspiration and self-improvement, source of pet projects
- [[My_pet_projects|Pet Projects]] to do something interesting and useful, also
  this is useful to practice what I learn.
- [[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]] for social activities and socializing.
- [[My_Physical_exercise_plan|physical exercises]] to increase quality of life
  and [[Health|health]].
- [[Media]] collection, for relax and fun.

## IRL

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages and
[[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]]. I also store my
[[How_do_I_work_with_contacts|contacts]] workflow.

[[Work]] is very important part of my life, it's allow keep my
[[Finance|finance]] budget stable, live actively and interesting.

[[Style_of_life|My style of life]] currently still chaotic, but I'm trying to
organize it. These notes are help me to do it.

Mentoring, I don't think I'm great at this, but I'm trying to help people on
[[GitHub]] projects, and in future on [[Stack_Overflow]]. Sometimes on different
platforms or IRL.
