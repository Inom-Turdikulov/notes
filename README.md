# Me and my [[Zettelkasten]] notes.

I keep my notes, mostly to improve my [[Learning|education process]], store
important information (for me) and share it with others.

## Super global tasks

1. Programming;
2. Promote;
3. Care.

## Activities

To build my daily plan and track what I'm doing I use [[Taskwarrior]] with
[[Getting_things_done_GTD|GTD methodology]], this helps me to manage my tasks
and projects.

I have some global tasks, which allow choosing what to do next:

- [[My_routine|Daily routine]], for more predictable life, if you haven't own
  routine someone's else will give you one.
- [[Work]] as main activity, which is main [[Finance|finance]] source, which I'm
  doing for living, carrier building and for fun (ideally). Check it for global
  tasks and projects first.
- [[Learning]], for inspiration and self-improvement, source of pet projects.
- [[My_pet_projects|Pet Projects]] to do something interesting and useful, also
  this is useful to practice what I learn.
- [[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]] for social activities and socializing.
- [[My_Physical_exercise_plan|physical exercises]] to increase quality of life
  and [[Health|health]].
- [[Media]] collection, for relax and fun.

## IRL

[[Style_of_life|My style of life]] currently still chaotic, but I'm trying to
organize it. These notes are help me to do it.

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages and
[[In_real_life_IRL|IRL]]. I also store my
[[How_do_I_work_with_contacts|contacts]] workflow.

Mentoring, I don't think I'm great at this, but I'm trying to help people on
[[GitHub]] projects, and in future on [[Stack_Overflow]]. Sometimes on different
platforms or IRL.
