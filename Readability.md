# Readability

> Readability, or textual difficulty, means how easy or hard a text is to read.
> Research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are
> read. How difficult the **words** are: this is lexical difficulty. Rare words
> are less well known than common words. Rare, difficult words are often longer
> than common, easy words. How difficult the **sentences** are: this is
> syntactical difficulty. Long, complicated sentences cause more difficulty than
> short, simple sentences. --

> Readability exists in both natural language and programming languages though
> in different forms. In programming, things such as programmer comments, choice
> of loop structure, and choice of names can determine the ease with which
> humans can read computer program code. --
