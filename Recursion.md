# Recursion (computer science)

> Method of solving a [[Computational_problem|computation_problem]] where the
> solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
> Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call
> themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many
> types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of
> [[Computer_science|computer science]].\

_Tree created using the Logo
programming language and relying heavily on recursion. Each branch can be seen
as a smaller version of a tree._
