> Sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. Usually such
> patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and
> replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. Regular expression
> techniques are developed in theoretical [[Computer_science]] and formal
> language theory.\
