# Runtime error detection

> Runtime error detection is a software verification method that analyzes a
> software application as it executes and reports defects that are detected
> during that execution. It can be applied during unit testing, component
> testing, integration testing, system testing (automated/scripted or manual),
> or penetration testing.
>
> Runtime error detection can identify defects that manifest themselves only at
> runtime (for example, file overwrites) and zeroing in on the root causes of
> the application crashing, running slowly, or behaving unpredictably. Defects
> commonly detected by runtime error detection include:
>
> - Race conditions
> - Exceptions
> - Resource leaks
> - Memory leaks
> - Security attack vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection)
> - Null pointers
> - Uninitialized memory
> - Buffer overflows
>
> Runtime error detection tools can only detect errors in the executed control
> flow of the application.
