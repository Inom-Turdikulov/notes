# SQLite

> SQLite (/ˌɛsˌkjuːˌɛlˈaɪt/, /ˈsiːkwəˌlaɪt/) is a database engine written in the
> C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library
> that software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the
> family of embedded databases. It is the most widely deployed database engine,
> as it is used by several of the top web browsers, operating systems, mobile
> phones, and other embedded systems.\
