# Self-hosting (web services)

> The practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private
> [[Web_server]], instead of using a service outside of someone's own control.
> Self-hosting allows users to have more control over their data, privacy, and
> computing infrastructure, as well as potentially saving costs and improving

For me self-hosting is way to easily share data between devices, and to have
full control over my data with minimal latency, and maximal speed.
