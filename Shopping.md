# Shopping

> Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or

> shoppers, that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure
> activity.\

I rarely go shopping. I prefer to buy things online.

I have [[My_buy_list|buy list]] where I store things I want to buy or what
required to buy (food, clothes, etc).
