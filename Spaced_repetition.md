# Spaced repetition

> Learning technique usually using flashcards, where information that is newer,
> and harder to remember are shown more frequently, while information that is
> older and easier to remember is shown less frequently.

> This is done to take advantage of the spacing effect which can be a better way
> and quicker way to learn and keep information.\

Right now I'm using [[Obsidian]] plugin
[spaced repetition](https://www.stephenmwangi.com/obsidian-spaced-repetition/)
