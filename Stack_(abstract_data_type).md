# Stack (abstract data type)

> In [[Computer_science]], a **stack** is an [[Abstract_data_type]] that serves
> as a [[Collection_(abstract_data_type)]] of elements, with two main
> operations:
>
> - **Push**, which adds an element to the collection, and
> - **Pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet
>   removed.
