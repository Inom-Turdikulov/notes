# Template

Template files have many different uses. I store some for documents, text notes
(markdown for example), graphics, web pages, boilerplate texts and other
purposes.

PDF templates for handwritten notes are stored
[here](file:///home/inom/Templates/google-drive/notes/), which originally
grabbed from [GitHub - flyguybravo/goodnotes](https://github.com/flyguybravo/goodnotes).
