# The Useless Pages

The Useless Web was an example of early web humor. Original site you can find in
[[Internet_archive]] -
[https://web.archive.org/web/20010616081433/http://www.go2net.com/useless/index.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20010616081433/http://www.go2net.com/useless/index.html).

I find them sometimes interesting and fun. Some of them can be source of
[[Artistic_inspiration|inspiration]] and
[[Idea|ideas]].

Here you can find random useless page:
[The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/).

[[Chrome_experiments]] to certain degree can be considered as
useless pages too, but I'm not sure.
