# Zettelkasten Method

My notes should be organized to evolve, save my time and bring benefits to me
and others.

I took general note ideas from Zettelkasten and
[Evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) notes.

Main principles of my note-taking method:

TODO: Need describe these principles

- Notes should be atomic
- Notes should be concept-oriented
- Notes should be linked
- Prefer relationships to hierarchy
- Write notes in personal-aware style, instead public-aware style

Notes can have various [[Zettelkasten_notes_type|types]].

I use [[Telekasten.nvim]] plugin to manage my notes with [[Zettelkasten]] method.
