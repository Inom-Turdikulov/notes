# Notes types which I use with Zettelkasten

This is initial table of notes types which I use with [[zettelkasten]]. I will
update it as I improve my workflow. To set note type need just apple tag from
left column to note.

| Tag           | Description                                                |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#inbox`      | Prompts and Incomplete notes (can be linked in log)        |
| `#weekly`     | Weakly working log                                         |
| `#defenition` | Simple definitions + little personal notes (or vice versa) |
| `#outline`    | Outline notes, various lists, plans, etc.                  |
| `#research`   | Literature notes                                           |
|               |                                                            |
| `#contact`    | Person notes                                               |
| `#log`        | Log notes                                                  |

TODO: check all tags and add description to each of them.
