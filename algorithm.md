# Algorithm

In general, it's, set of step-by-step instructions for solving some problem
([[logic|logical]] or [[mathematics|mathematical]], or to perform some other
**task** (for example something from real world).

In other words a set of instructions for completing a specific task.

Algorithm are used as specifications for performing computation and data
processing.

In computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by
a [[turing machine]]. For the purpose of [[computation|computing]], algorithms
are written in [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart|flow charts]], or
[[programming language]].

Sometimes, it’s possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the
same task ()[[computational complexity]]. One algorithm can be faster than the
other by orders of magnitude.

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian
mathematician called 'Al-Khwārizmī' (he is practically from my **homeland**)
(Persian: خوارزمی, c. 780–850).
