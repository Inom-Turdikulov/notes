## How I fight against anxiety

- Things which I can't solve, I don't worry about them.
- Things which I can solve, but it's require too much time and confirmation, I
  can worry about them, but I need sort of "green light" to start solving them.
- I'm reducing my troubles by solving things which I can solve.
- Calendar can reduce my troubles by reminding me of things which I can solve.
