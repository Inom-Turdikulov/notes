Art - various human activity and it's resulting product, that include
imaginative, creative talent.

Art expresses technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power and conceptual
ideas.

For me Art is sort of self-expression, when I have a need to express my thoughts
or just "creative copy" something beautiful.

I'm fan of fine art and CGI art.
