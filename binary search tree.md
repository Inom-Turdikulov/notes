A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the
principle of [[binary search algorithm|binary search]].

| Algorithm | **Average** | **Worst case** |
| Space     | O(_n_)      | O(_n_)         |
| Search    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
| Insert    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
| Delete    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
