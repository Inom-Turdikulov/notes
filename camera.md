> A camera is an optical instrument that captures [[202303120145-My
> Pictures|images]]. Most cameras can capture 2D images, while some more
> advanced models can capture [[202303121542-VR photography (virtual-reality
> photography)|3D images]]. At a basic level, most cameras consist of a sealed
> box (the camera body), with a small hole (the aperture) that allows
> [[light|light ]] to pass through and capture an image on a
> light-sensitive surface (usually a digital sensor or photographic film).
> Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the
> light-sensitive surface, including lenses that focus the light and a shutter
> that determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to
> the light.
