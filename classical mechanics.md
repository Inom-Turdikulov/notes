# Classical mechanics

> [[physics|physical]] theory describing the motion of macroscopic objects, from
> projectiles to parts of machinery and astronomical objects, such as
> spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. For objects governed by classical
> mechanics, if the present state is known, it is possible to predict how it
> will move in the future (determinism), and how it has moved in the past
> (reversibility).
