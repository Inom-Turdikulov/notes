> In [[computer science]], the computational complexity or simply
> complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it.
> Particular focus is given to
> [[time complexity|computation time]](generally measured by the
> number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The
> complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow
> solving the problem.
