# Computer Science

Computer science connect theory (computation, automation, information) with real
world practice (software and hardware). In Russian, it's known as
**Информа́тика**.

In computer science central role plays [[algorithm|algorithms]] and
[[data structure|data structures]].

I think knowing computer science help to write effective [[code]] (goal of good
[[programmer (software developer)], which I want to be]).

I described how I learn computer science here: [[how do I study computer
science]].
