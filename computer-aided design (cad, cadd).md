# Computer-aided design (CAD, CADD)

> Use of [[computer|computers]] (or workstations) to aid in the
> creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. This
> [[computer program|software]] is used to increase the
> productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve
> communications through documentation, and to create a database for
> manufacturing. Designs made through CAD software are helpful in protecting
> products and inventions when used in patent applications. CAD output is often
> in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing
> operations. The terms computer-aided drafting (CAD) and computer aided design
> and drafting (CADD) are also used.
>
> CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional (2D) space; or
> curves, surfaces, and solids in three-dimensional (3D) space.
>
> CAD has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry,
> [[computer graphics]] (both hardware and software), and discrete
> differential geometry.
