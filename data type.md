In modern language like Python, JavaScript you can even not working with data
types (modern days you can use some ways for use types).

- Int: -2^31 to 2^31-1
- Float: 32-bit, 1 bit sign bit, exponent part 8-bit, mantissa 23-bit
- Char: -128 to 127
- String: `char [10] = "Studying";`
- Void: no value, ::TODO: is void a type?::
