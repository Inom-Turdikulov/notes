I widely use dmenu in my scripts, which linked with my global shortcuts. It's
allow integrating CLI programs with nice looking UI to quickly run desired
actions.

You can use dmenu as programs launcher (main purpose), search tool, etc. One of
popular alternative is `rofi`, but for me, it's too complex.

dmenu is keyboard oriented program, and need to use it's
[[dmenu keybindings|keybindings]].
