> Electronic design automation (EDA), also referred to as electronic
> computer-aided design (ECAD), is a category of
> [[my awesome software list#eda|software tools]] for designing
> electronic systems such as integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. The
> tools work together in a design flow that chip designers use to design and
> analyze entire semiconductor chips. Since a modern semiconductor chip can have
> billions of components, EDA tools are essential for their design; this article
> in particular describes EDA specifically with respect to integrated circuits
> (ICs).
