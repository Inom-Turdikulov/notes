# Elementary particles

> In particle [[physics|physics]], an elementary particle or fundamental
> particle is a subatomic particle that is not composed of other particles.
> Particles currently thought to be elementary include electrons, the
> fundamental fermions (quarks, leptons, antiquarks, and antileptons, which
> generally are matter particles and antimatter particles), as well as the
> fundamental bosons (gauge bosons and the Higgs boson), which generally are
> force particles that mediate interactions among fermions. A particle
> containing two or more elementary particles is a composite particle.
