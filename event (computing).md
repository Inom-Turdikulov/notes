> Action or occurrence recognized by [[computer program|software]],
> often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be
> handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or triggered by the
> [[operating system|system]], by the user, or in other ways.
> Typically, events are handled synchronously with the program flow; that is,
> the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled,
> frequently an event loop.
