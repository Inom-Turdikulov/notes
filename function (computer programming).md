# Function (computer programming)

> In [[computer programming]], a function or subroutine is a sequence of program
> instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can
> then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.
>
> Functions may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can
> be used by many programs. In different programming languages, a function may
> be called a routine, subprogram, subroutine, method, or procedure.
>
> The content of a function is its body, which is the piece of program code that
> is executed when the function is called or invoked. A function may be written
> so that it expects to obtain one or more data values from the calling program
> (to replace its parameters or formal parameters). The calling program provides
> actual values for these parameters, called arguments.
>
> A function call may also have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]]
> such as modifying data structures in a computer memory, reading from or
> writing to a peripheral device, creating a file, halting the program or the
> machine, or even delaying the program's execution for a specified time.
