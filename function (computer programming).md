> In [[computer programming]], a function or subroutine is a
> sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a
> unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task
> should be performed.
>
> Functions may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can
> be used by many programs. In different programming languages, a function may
> be called a routine, subprogram, subroutine, method, or procedure.
>
> The content of a function is its body, which is the piece of program code that
> is executed when the function is called or invoked.
> A function may be written so that it expects to obtain one or more data values
> from the calling program (to replace its parameters or formal parameters). The
> calling program provides actual values for these parameters, called arguments.
>
> A function call may also have
> [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]] such as modifying
> data structures in a computer memory, reading from or writing to a peripheral
> device, creating a file, halting the program or the machine, or even delaying
> the program's execution for a specified time.
