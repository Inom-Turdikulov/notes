# How do I study Computer Science?

My first book was Russian book "Информатика и информационные технологии. 10-11
классы" [@UgrinovichNikolayDmitrievichInformatikaInformacionnyeTehnologii] and
some methodical materials from teachers. I started to read after 9th grade (1
year later) and this give me my initial knowledge about computer science, basic
algorithms, Visual Basic and office programs. And I think here was sort
observation of internet/web technologies. Currently, I think better to dive into
computer science with [[@CharlesPetzoldCodeHiddenLanguage2000]] which give much
more fundamental knowledge.

My next book, which I found useful is "The C Programming Language"
[@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988]. I read it and do exercises from it.
My current goal is complete it and start to dive into [[algorithm|algorithms]]
and [[data structure|data structures]].

I also in parallel work with Python (paid job) and read official
tutorials/documentation to write better Python code.

## Conventions

- TODO - I want to work with it sometimes in the future.
- NEXT - I want to work with it ASAP.
- NOW - I work with it now.
- DONE - I finished basic work with it. But I can learn flashcards or do
  exercises from it.
- KILL - I don't want to work with it (maybe I will change my mind in the
  future).

Roadmap - other people's roadmaps or my own, which I want to follow.

**Level 1** - basic knowledge, foundation knowledge, which I want to know.

**Level 2** - advanced knowledge, specific instruments/languages/libraries, which I
want to know.

**Level 3** - expert knowledge, which I want to know. This also includes some
books not directly related to computer science.

## [[my python developer roadmap|Python developer roadmap]]

## [[my backend developer roadmap|Backend Developer Roadmap]]

## Level 1

- NOW: [[@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988]] basic reading
- NOW: [[@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988]] exercises, but I do it rarely
  right now, to save time for other things.
- NOW: [[@PythonTutorial2023]], to refresh knowledge
- NOW: [[comprehensive python cheatsheet]], I'm writing flashcards from it, I
  think it's will be very useful to know syntax/core libraries.
- NOW: [[@EricMatthesPythonCrashCourse2023]], really quick reading, to refresh
  knowledge, maybe I find something new.

- NEXT: [[@CharlesPetzoldCodeHiddenLanguage2000]].
- NEXT: [[@LucianoRamalhoFluentPython2021]], python complete reading
- NEXT: [[@JayWengrowCommonsenseGuideData2020]].
- NEXT: [[@InterviewCakeCodingInterviewPractice]], to learn algorithms and data
  structures. I think worth to do it after
  [[@JayWengrowCommonsenseGuideData2020]]
- NEXT: [[@AndreyViktorovichStolyarovProgrammirovanieVvedenieProfessiyu2021b]]
