# How I study Computer Science?

My first book was Russian book "Информатика и информационные технологии. 10-11
классы" [@UgrinovichNikolayDmitrievichInformatikaInformacionnyeTehnologii] and
some methodical materials from teachers. I started to read after 9th grade (1
year later) and this give me my initial knowledge about computer science, basic
algorithms, Visual Basic and office programs. And I think here was sort
observation of internet/web technologies. Currently, I think better to dive into
computer science with [[CharlesPetzoldCodeHiddenLanguage2000]] which give much
more fundamental knowledge.

My next book, which I found useful is "The C Programming Language"
[@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988]. I read it and do exercises from it.
My current goal is complete it and start to dive into [[algorithm|algorithms]]
and [[data structure|data structures]].

I also in parallel work with Python (paid job) and read official
tutorials/documentation to write better Python code.

## Active Learning

- [ ] [[@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988]] basic reading
- [ ] [[@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988]] exercises
- [ ] [[@PythonTutorial2023]], to refresh knowledge
- [ ] [[comprehensive python cheatsheet]], I'm writing flashcards from it, I think
  it's will be very useful to know syntax/core libraries.

## TODO

- [ ] [[@LucianoRamalhoFluentPython2021]].
- [ ] [[@InterviewCakeCodingInterviewPractice]].
- [ ] [[@JayWengrowCommonsenseGuideData2020]].
- [ ] [[@CharlesPetzoldCodeHiddenLanguage2000]].
