# In real life (IRL)

IRL is abbreviation for "in real life". I use it to describe my real life
activities.

For life support I need [[my buy list|buy some things]], [[cooking|cook]] food
and [[my inventory|keep inventory]].

Sometimes I do some [[do it yourself|cool things]] or spent time for [[art]].

Also, worth to mention this notes [[home construction]] and [[government]].
