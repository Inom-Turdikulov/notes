# <i>The Lute Player</i> (Caravaggio)

The Lute Player is a composition by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio. It
used to exist in two versions, one in the Wildenstein Collection and another in
the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg. However, a third from Badminton House,
Gloucestershire, came to light in 2007.
