# The Fill-In Filmography

A massive mapping of cinematic genres (with representative movies for each category), this big-screen behemoth is fully customizable to reflect your personal tastes—just grab a pencil and fill in the circle next to each film to mark it as “Loved It,” “Liked It,” or merely “Watched It”! Whether your prefer Period Pieces, Musicals, or tales of Haunted Dolls, there’s something here for cinephiles of every sort.
Note that unlike our other frames, this version has no acrylic sheet over the print, for obvious pencil-enabling purposes.
