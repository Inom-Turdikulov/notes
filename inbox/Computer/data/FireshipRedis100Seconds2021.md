# Redis in 100 Seconds

Use the special link https://redis.info/fireship (or code: MATRIX200) to try Redis Enterprise Cloud to get a $200 credit, become part of a weekly raffle, and a chance to win a Tesla Model 3(Terms and conditions apply)!

Redis is an extremely fast in-memory database often used as a cache. It has evolved into a multi-model database with support for graphs, JSON documents, full-text search, and more. Try Redis Enterprise for free https://bit.ly/3wnVsXA

Note. I collaborated with RedisLabs on this video, but I maintained full creative control over the content - Redis itâ€™s a product I genuinely like and use (like all topics on my channel).
