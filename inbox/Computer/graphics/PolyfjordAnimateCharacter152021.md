# Animate a Character in 15 Minutes in Blender

Learn how to model, rig and animate a walking character in 15 minutes! We'll create a quadruped that can walk in any direction, using a combination of curves, constraints and armature. Then we'll tie it all together with random movement, giving it life and personality!
