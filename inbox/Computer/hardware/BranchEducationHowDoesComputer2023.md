Have you ever wondered what it would be like to journey through the inside of your computer?  In this video, we're taking you on a 3D animated adventure to every piece of computer hardware inside a desktop computer.  You'll also see a nanoscopic view of the transistors inside the CPU and GPU.  This video is like a biology dissection lab; instead, we're opening up a computer and seeing all the various computer hardware inside.
