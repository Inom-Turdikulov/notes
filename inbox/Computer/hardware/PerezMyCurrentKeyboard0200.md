# My current keyboard layout :: Eli Rodríguez Pérez — Personal blog

As you may have realized based on my previous post, I&rsquo;m really into improving my efficiency when it comes to programming and using the keyboard in general. That&rsquo;s why I got into Vim and that&rsquo;s why now I&rsquo;m into keyboard stuff. When I was little I remember my dad teaching me to touch type, we didn&rsquo;t even have a computer at home, but my dad thought it was important for me to learn to use a keyboard and brought an old typewriter home.
