# C23 (C standard revision)

C23 is the informal name for what will likely become ISO/IEC 9899:2024, the next standard for the C programming language, which will replace C17 (standard ISO/IEC 9899:2018).  It was started in 2016 informally as C2x, and expected to be published in 2024.  The most recent publicly available working draft of C23 was released on April 1, 2023.  The first WG14 meeting for the C2x draft was held in October 2019, virtual remote meetings were held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, then various teleconference meetings continued to occur through 2023.
