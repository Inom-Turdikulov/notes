# Math Skills: How to find Factorial, Permutation and Combination (Choose)

In this video we discuss the factorial of a number (n!), the number of ways to permute (nPr) and the number of ways to choose a combination (nCr).  We explain how to calculate these on your calculator, and most importantly, what these numbers are actually counting!
Another useful dose of Maths for everyone by Dr Sarada Herke.
