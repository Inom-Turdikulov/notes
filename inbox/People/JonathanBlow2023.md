# Jonathan Blow

Jonathan Blow (born 1971) is an American video game designer and programmer. He is best known for his work on the independent video games Braid (2008) and The Witness (2016).
Blow was born in California, United States, and became interested in game programming while at middle school, and studied for a double degree in computer science and English at the University of California, Berkeley. After dropping out of college, he and a friend started a game company that closed following the dot-com crash, after which he worked as a game-development contractor. Blow co-founded the Experimental Gameplay Workshop and wrote a monthly technical column for Game Developer magazine. Blow gained prominence in 2008 with Braid.
He used the financial success of Braid to fund his next game The Witness, and formed a company called Thekla Inc. After a lengthy development period, The Witness was released in 2016, and like Braid was critically and financially successful. During its development, Blow began designing and creating a new programming language after being frustrated with C++, the language Thekla used to program the game. Full-time work on the language, which is code-named Jai, and a new game implemented in it began after the release of The Witness. A compiler for the Jai language is current in beta release.
Blow's games are known for being artistic and challenging. They are made with custom game engines, and have larger budgets and longer development times than most independently funded games. Blow featured in Indie Game: The Movie, and is known for having strong opinions about the gaming industry.
