# Introduction to Numerical Computing with NumPy | SciPy 2019 Tutorial | Alex Chabot-Leclerc

NumPy provides Python with a powerful array processing library and an elegant syntax that is well suited to expressing computational algorithms clearly and efficiently. We'll introduce basic array syntax and array indexing, review some of the available mathematical functions in NumPy, and discuss how to write your own routines. Along the way, we'll learn just enough about matplotlib to display results from our examples.
