# Common Derivatives and Integrals

Here is a set of common derivatives and integrals that are used somewhat regularly in a Calculus I or Calculus II class. Also included are reminders on several integration techniques. here are two versions of the cheat sheet available. One is full sized and is currently four pages. The other version is a reduced version that contains exactly the same information as the full version except it has just been shrunk down so two pages print of the front and two pages print on the back of a single piece of paper.
