# Lecture 8 | Programming Abstractions (Stanford)

Lecture 8 by Julie Zelenski for the Programming Abstractions Course (CS106B) in the Stanford Computer Science Department.

Julie talks about solving problems recursively. She covers functional recursion with the simple example of writing an exponential function using recursion. From the simple program performing as an exponential function Julie continues to show a more efficient recursion code. The next example she covers is that of binary search and how recursion is used in this instance.
