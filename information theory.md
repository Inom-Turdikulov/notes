# Information theory

> Branch of applied [[mathematics|mathematic]] and electrical
> engineering. Information theory measures the amount of information in data
> that could have more than one value. In its most common use, information
> theory finds [[physics|physical]] and mathematical limits on the
> amounts of data in data compression and data communication. Data compression
> and data communication are statistical, because they guess unknown values. The
> amount of information in data measures how easily it is guessed by a person
> who does not know its value.
