# Job interview

> Interview consisting of a conversation between a job applicant and a
> representative of an employer which is conducted to assess whether the
> applicant should be hired. Interviews are one of the most popularly used
> devices for employee selection. Interviews vary in the extent to which the
> questions are structured, from a totally unstructured and free-wheeling
> conversation to a structured interview in which an applicant is asked a
> predetermined list of questions in a specified order; structured interviews
> are usually more accurate predictors of which applicants will make suitable
> employees, according to research studies.
