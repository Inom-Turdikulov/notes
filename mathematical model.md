# Mathematical model

> A [[mathematics|mathematical]] model is an abstract description of a concrete
> system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a
> mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling.
>
> Mathematical models are used in applied mathematics and in the natural
> [[science]]s (such as [[physics]], biology, earth science, chemistry) and
> engineering disciplines (such as [[computer science]], electrical
> engineering), as well as in non-physical systems such as the social sciences
> (such as economics, [[psychology]], sociology, political science). It can also
> be taught as a subject in its own right.
