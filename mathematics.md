> Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. The word comes from
> the Greek μάθημα (máthema), meaning "science, knowledge, or learning", and is
> sometimes shortened to maths (in British Commonwealth countries) or math (in
> North America).
>
> It is the study of:
>
> - Numbers: including how things can be counted.
> - Structure: including how things are organized, but also how they can be or
>   could have been. This subfield is usually called algebra.
> - Place: where things are, and spatial arrangement, including arrangements of
>   spaces themselves. This subfield is usually called geometry.
> - Change: how things become different. This subfield is usually called
>   analysis.
> - Applied math is useful for solving problems in the real world. People
>   working in business, science, engineering, and construction use mathematics.
