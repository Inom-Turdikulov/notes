# Matrix (mathematics)

> In [[mathematics]], a **matrix** (plural **matrices**) is a rectangular
> [[array (computer science)|array*]] or table of [[number]], symbol, or

For example, $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 9 & -13 \\20 & 5 & -6 \end{bmatrix}$$
is a matrix with two rows and three columns. This is often referred to as a
"two by three matrix", a "$2\times 3$ matrix", or a matrix of dimension
$2\times 3$.

Links to array and expression are from [[computer science]], but better to check
corresponding definitions in mathematics.
