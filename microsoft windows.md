Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families
developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of
the computing industry. Active Windows families include Windows NT and Windows
IoT; these may encompass subfamilies, (e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded
Compact) (Windows CE). Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows
Mobile and Windows Phone.

Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20,
1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the
growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).\[6\]

Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI
development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh
(eventually settled in court in Microsoft\'s favor in 1993). On PCs, Windows is
still the most popular operating system in all countries.\[7\]\[8\] However, in
2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system
market to Android,\[9\] because of the massive growth in sales of Android
smartphones. In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that
of Android devices sold. According to StatCounter, for desktop and laptop
computers Windows has approximately 75% market share as of April 2022.\[10\]

As of October 2021, the most recent version of Windows for PCs and tablets is
Windows 11, version 21H2. The most recent version for embedded devices is
Windows 11, version 21H2.\[11\] The most recent version for server computers is
Windows Server 2022, version 21H2.\[12\] A specialized version of Windows also
runs on the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S video game consoles.\[13\]
