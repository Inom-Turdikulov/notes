# My daily activities and goals

This page contains actual lists of things I'm doing [[now]] (daily activities),
long term goals and some other things. I need constantly check and update this
page, because all things are changing.

This page is a part of my [[zettelkasten]].

## Work and long-term projects

This is very important part of my life, it's allow keep my [[finance]] stable,
live actively and interesting. I'm working now as a software engineer in a small
company (remote, full-stack position, but moving into
[[my backend developer roadmap|backend]] position).

I organize my work using, [[getting things done (gtd)|gtd]] mainly using Inbox,
Tasks (TODO and NEXT), Daily and Weekly notes.

To follow external timelines I sometimes use [[calendar]] events, but it's
secondary task planner.

To connect with colleagues I use [[instant messaging]] and [[email]] clients.

In my work significantly help my [[development environment]], [[backup]] plan
and daily [[maintenance]], with attention to [[computer security]].

Currently, I'm working on social platform automation project.

## Social activity and family

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages. Here is
[[how do i work with contacts]] if you need to write something to me.

## Exercise and health

Right now I'm trying to follow my personal [[exercise plan]] and
[[my everyday life (routine)]] routine.

## Relax and fun

I can also spend time with my family, friends and pets or consume some media,
for example:

- Watching [[my movies|movies]], [[twitch (service)|twitch]],
  [[youtube|youtube]]
- Playing [[my games]]
- Reading [[my read books]] and [[news]]
- Listening [[my music]]
- Art [[my art]]

And of course healthy [[sleep]].

## Education and self-development

I'm trying to learn new things every day. Currently, I'm studying (this is
plan):

Here my "to learn" books list: [[my read books]].

Here my "to learn" articles list: [[my articles list (publishing)]].

Since I'm use [[zettelkasten]], I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources, my experience, etc.

To study effectively I use [[SQ3R method]], [[how to study|study techniques]]
and various methods [[how to solve it]]. More information here - [[education]].

It's not enough to study only, need continuously practice (use your knowledge)
and test yourself, to solve this problem I use [[spaced repetition]] and
implement my [[my pet projects|pet projects]] and
[[work (human activity)|working projects]].

## IRL, government and other things

Check this note [[in real life (irl)]].

## Mentoring and helping

I don't think I'm great at this, but I'm trying to help people on [[github]],
and in future on [[stack overflow]]. Sometimes on different platforms or IRL.
