# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

I split my working day into 8 chunks, and I'm trying to follow them every day.

## Chunk #1. Wake-up, Plan and Run

Initialization, want to do good wake-up, care about my body, warm-up and walk.
Wake-up with good moon, make your day better. I feel better if I wake up from
8:00 am.

Good checklist for wake-up:

- Wash your face and brush your teeth, both are important.
- Drink a glass of water.
- Plan something important, at least 3 big tasks.
- Review your calendar and tasks.
- Do basic training, 20–35 minutes sessions (in my case run).
- Walk outside for 10–20 minutes to get enough energy from sun (Vitamin D).
- Prepare your workspace.

## Chunk #2. Learning

Schedule anything unimportant and disable distractions, prepare water, breath
deeply and start working.

Main goals:

- Time amount about 2 hours.
- Reduce distractions, let know everyone you will be busy.
- Focus on main tasks, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks and working session.
- Take at least one big break in this session.
- Drink more water to stay hydrated.

## Chunk #3. Initial Working and Lunch

Here I start [[work|working]] some time before lunch (initial working). I give
my mind some time to switch from learning to working and think about tasks while
eating.

You can prepare your lunch in the morning or in the evening. Give rest to your
eyes and mind and fuel your body and give time to food digestion.
This is good time to do something brainless, with low energy consumption.

## Chunk #4. Recovery and Main Working time

Personally it's hard for me to do something brain-related after lunch some time,
and I need about 1–2 hours to recover. So first I'm doing some light tasks, like
cleaning, reading, watching, etc. and then start my main working time.

Complete main tasks with notes from chunk #2 (learn), connect with people, help
them. Mark completed tasks. You can also work in this time on side projects,
freelance, self-promotion or other tasks if you are not busy with working tasks.

## Chunk #5. Workout

Only morning physical activity is not enough for me. I need to do some physical
activity in the evening. It's good to do it after work.

Regular work-out are important for better energy and healthy mind. Better to do
it according [[my_physical_exercise_plan|plan]] and track your progress.

## Chunk #6. Pet projects, fun (no fun no life), family

Starting somewhere in 19:00 pm.

It's good time to practice learned information by working with
[[my_pet_projects|pet projects]], relax, do everyday tasks and have fun.

Be helpful and thankful but don't forget about yourself and your family.

## Chunk #7. Prepare for tomorrow

Starting somewhere in 22:00 pm. I stop doing anything heavy brain energy
consuming.

- Plan your week, month, year, life.
- Check your [[work#Goals|goals]], expertness, health, family and calendar.
- Place E-devices on charger.
- Review and adjust resume, working profiles, social networks.
- Upload videos, photos, articles, etc.

## Chunk #8. Rest

Rest, to be ready for tomorrow, don't try to make longer your day (this is bad
idea). Try to start sleep maximum at 00:00 am. Do something relaxing, breath
deeply, listen to music, etc. if you can't sleep.
