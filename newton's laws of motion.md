# Newton's laws of motion

> Three basic laws of [[classical mechanics|classical mechanics]]
> that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces
> acting on it. These laws can be paraphrased as follows:
>
> 1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line,
> unless acted upon by a force.
>
> 2. When a body is acted upon by a force, the time
> rate of change of its momentum equals the force.
>
> 3. If two bodies exert forces on
> each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.
