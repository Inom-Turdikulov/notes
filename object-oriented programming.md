# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

> Way of writing computer programs using "objects" to stand for data and
> methods. Often, computer programs that are not object-oriented are a list of
> instructions for the computer, telling it to do certain things in a certain
> way.

Be careful, OOP can produce a lot of boilerplate code. It's not always the best
solution.
