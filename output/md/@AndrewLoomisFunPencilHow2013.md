Andrew Loomis (1892-1959) is revered amongst artists - including comics   
superstar Alex Ross - for his mastery of drawing. His first book, Fun With a   
Pencil, published in 1939 is a wonderfully crafted and engaging introduction to   
drawing, cartooning, and capturing the essence of a subject all while having   
fun. With delightful step-by-step instruction from Professor Blook, Loomis's   
charming alter ego on the page.
