  language'
---

JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used by more software
developers today than any other programming language. For nearly 25 years this
best seller has been the go-to guide for JavaScript programmers. The seventh
edition is fully updated to cover the 2020 version of JavaScript, and new
chapters cover classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, async/await,
and metaprogramming. You'll find illuminating and engaging example code
throughout. This book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for
web developers who want to take their understanding and mastery to the next
level. It begins by explaining the JavaScript language itself, in detail, from
the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation to cover the web platform and
Node.js. Topics include: Types, values, variables, expressions, operators,
statements, objects, and arrays Functions, classes, modules, iterators,
generators, Promises, and async/await JavaScript's standard library: data
structures, regular expressions, JSON, i18n, et cetera The web platform:
documents, components, graphics, networking, storage, and threads Node.js:
buffers, files, streams, threads, child processes, web clients, and web servers
Tools and language extensions that professional JavaScript developers rely on.
