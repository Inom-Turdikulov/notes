# Btrfs (better F S)

Btrfs includes native optimizations for SSD media. To enable
these features, mount the Btrfs filesystem with the -o SSD mount option. These
optimizations include enhanced SSD write performance by avoiding optimization
such as seek optimizations which do not apply to solid-state media.

Asynchronous discard support is available with mount option `discard=async`, and
is enabled by default as of linux 6.2.

Here list of "safe" commands for btrfs:

```sh
mkfs.btrfs # create a btrfs filesystem

btrfs scrub # pass over all filesystem data and metadata and verifying the
            # checksums, not same as fsck

btrfs balance # spread block groups across all devices so they match constraints
              # defined by the respective profiles, it's NOT a defragmentation

btrfs device stats # show statistics about devices, 0 means no errors

btrfs filesystem df # show disk space usage information for a btrfs filesystem

btrfs filesystem du # show disk usage by files and directories for a btrfs
                    # filesystem
```


Periods for maintenance:
balance - weekly, example: `btrfs balance -dusage=50 -dlimit=2`
scrub - monthly, with full system backup
check `discard=async` is enabled by default as of linux 6.2. TODO: check actual
mount options.

`btrfs check` is not safe, it's experimental and can corrupt data (2021).
