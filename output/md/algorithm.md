# Algorithm

In general, it's, set of step-by-step instructions for solving some problem
([logical](./logic.md) or [mathematical](./mathematics.md), or to perform some other
**task** (for example something from real world).

In other words a set of instructions for completing a specific task.

Algorithm are used as specifications for performing computation and data
processing.

In computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by
a [turing machine](./turing%20machine.md). For the purpose of [computing](./computation.md), algorithms
are written in [pseudocode](./pseudocode.md), [flow charts](./flowchart.md), or
[programming language](./programming%20language.md).

Sometimes, it’s possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the
same task ()[computational complexity](./computational%20complexity.md). One algorithm can be faster than the
other by orders of magnitude.

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian
mathematician called 'Al-Khwārizmī' (he is practically from my **homeland**)
(Persian: خوارزمی, c. 780–850).
