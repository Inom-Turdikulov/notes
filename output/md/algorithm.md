# Algorithm

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian
mathematician called 'Al-Khwārizmī' (he is practically from my **homeland**)
(Persian: خوارزمی, c. 780–850).

In general, it's, set of finite step-by-step instructions for solving some
problem ([logical](./logic.md) or [mathematical](./mathematics.md)), or to perform some
other **task** (for example something from real world, like
problem/computation). In other words a set of instructions for completing a
specific task.

Algorithm are used as specifications for performing computation and data
processing.

In computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by
a [Turing machine](./Turing%20machine.md). For the purpose of [computing](./computation.md), algorithms
are written in [pseudocode](./pseudocode.md), [flowchart](./flowchart.md), or [programming language](./programming%20language.md).

Sometimes, it’s possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the
same task [computational complexity](./computational%20complexity.md). One algorithm can be faster than the
other by *orders of magnitude*.
