title: B-tree
---

> B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
> allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in
> [logarithmic](./logarithm%20%28logs%29.md) time. The B-tree generalizes the
> binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children. Unlike
> other self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for
> storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as
> databases and file systems.
