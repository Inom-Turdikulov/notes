# Computational complexity

> In [computer science](./computer%20science.md), the computational complexity or simply
> complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it.
> Particular focus is given to
> [computation time](./time%20complexity.md)(generally measured by the
> number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The
> complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow
> solving the problem.
