Computer science connect theory (computation, automation, information) with real
world practice (software and hardware). In Russian, it's known as
**Информа́тика**.

In computer science central role plays [algorithms](./algorithm.md) and
[data structures](./data%20structure.md).

I think knowing computer science help to write effective [code](./code.md) (goal of good
[[programmer (software developer)], which I want to be]).

I described how I learn computer science here: [[how do I study computer
science]].
