## Cuisines of Russia, Ukraine and other countries of former Soviet Union   
   
Some information about cutlets from Wikipedia [@Cutlet2023]:   
   
> In modern Russian, the word kotleta (котлета) refers almost exclusively to   
> pan-fried minced meat croquettes / cutlet-shaped patties. Bread soaked in   
> milk, onions, garlic, and herbs is usually present in the recipe. When in a   
> hurry, a "cutlet" can be eaten between bread slices like a hamburger, but this   
> fast meal is rarely served in restaurants. It is usually served with pan-fried   
> potatoes, mashed potatoes, pasta, etc.   
   
> A particular form of the Russian kotleta known as Pozharsky cutlet is an   
> elaborated version of minced poultry kotleta covered with breadcrumbs or small   
> croutons. A distinct feature of this cutlet is that butter is added to minced   
> meat, which results in an especially juicy and tender consistency.   
   
> Another Russian version of a cutlet, called otbivnaya kotleta (отбивная   
> котлета), meaning "beaten cutlet", is a fried slice of meat, usually pork or   
> beef, beaten flat with a tenderizing hammer or knife handle and covered with   
> beaten eggs, dough or breadcrumbs. The recipe is similar to those of   
> escalopes, schnitzel, Polish, or American cutlets. Today, this dish is simply   
> called otbivnaya, with the word kotleta reserved for minced meat patties.   
   
> Chicken Kiev is called kotleta po-kievski (котлета по-киевски) in Russian and   
> similarly kotleta po-kyivski (котлета по-київськи) in Ukrainian, which means   
> "Kiev-style cutlet".
