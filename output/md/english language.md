# English language

> English is a language that started in Anglo-Saxon England. It is originally
> from Anglo-Frisian and Old Saxon dialects. English is now used as a global
> language. There are about 375 million native speakers (people who use it as
> their first language) in the world.
>
> Frisian is the language closest to English. The vocabulary of English was
> influenced by other Germanic languages in the early Middle Ages and later by
> Romance languages, especially French.
>
> English has changed and developed over time, like all other languages. The
> most obvious changes are the many words taken from Latin and Old French, which
> then came to Old English and then Modern English, which is used today.
>
> English grammar has also become very different from other Germanic languages,
> but it stayed different from Romance languages. Because nearly 60% of the
> vocabulary comes from Latin, English is sometimes called the Germanic language
> that is the most Latin, and it is often mistaken for being a Romance language.
