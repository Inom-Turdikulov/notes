Git is useful to work with code without fear, you can experiment with code, use
multiple branches as features tree, if your decision was incorrect, you can
easily revert you changes. It's also useful for review your changes and
collaborate.

In [git tips](./git%20tips.md) I store various flashcards, how to use git (sort of cheatcheet).

Additional details can be found in
[papis/315c92066071c34465a13ed21a22f8e4-chacon-scott-and-st/notes](/not_created.md) book. You
can also use built-in help: `man git`, `git help` or `git [command] â€“help`.
