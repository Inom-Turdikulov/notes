# Heap (data structure)

Tree data structure, which convenient to specific heap property:

In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key
(the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the
key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.\[2\] The node at the \"top\" of
the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.

Heap is a special type of binary tree.

Criteria:


- it\'s complete binary tree
- values of each node must be no greater (or less) than value of it\'\'s child
  nodes.
