title: Heap (data structure)
---
   
Tree data structure, which convenient to specific heap property:   
   
In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key   
(the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the   
key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.\[2\] The node at the \"top\" of   
the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.   
   
Heap is a special type of binary tree.   
   
Criteria:   
   
   
- it\'s complete binary tree   
- values of each node must be no greater (or less) than value of it\'\'s child   
  nodes.
