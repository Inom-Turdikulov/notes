# How I study Computer Science?

My first book was Russian book "Информатика и информационные технологии. 10-11
классы" [@UgrinovichNikolayDmitrievichInformatikaInformacionnyeTehnologii] and
some methodical materials from teachers. I started to read after 9th grade (1
year later) and this give me my initial knowledge about computer science, basic
algorithms, Visual Basic and office programs. And I think here was sort
observation of internet/web technologies. Currently, I think better to dive into
computer science with [@CharlesPetzoldCodeHiddenLanguage2000](./%40CharlesPetzoldCodeHiddenLanguage2000.md) which give much
more fundamental knowledge.

My next book, which I found useful is "The C Programming Language"
[@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988]. I read it and do exercises from it.
My current goal is complete it and start to dive into [algorithms](./algorithm.md)
and [data structures](./data%20structure.md).

I also in parallel work with Python (paid job) and read official
tutorials/documentation to write better Python code.

## Active Learning


- [ ] [@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988](./%40BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988.md) basic reading
- [ ] [@BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988](./%40BrianWKernighanProgrammingLanguage1988.md) exercises
- [ ] [@PythonTutorial2023](./%40PythonTutorial2023.md), to refresh knowledge
- [ ] [comprehensive python cheatsheet](./comprehensive%20python%20cheatsheet.md), I'm writing flashcards from it, I think
  it's will be very useful to know syntax/core libraries.
