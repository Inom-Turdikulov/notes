# In real life (IRL)

IRL is abbreviation for "in real life". I use it to describe my real life
activities.

For life support I need [buy some things](./my%20buy%20list.md), [cook](./cooking.md) food
and [keep inventory](./my%20inventory.md).

Sometimes I do some [cool things](./do%20it%20yourself.md) or spent time for [art](./art.md).

Also, worth to mention this notes [home construction](./home%20construction.md) and [government](./government.md).
