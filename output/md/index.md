# My daily activities and goals

This page contains actual lists of things I'm doing [now](./now.md) (daily activities),
long term goals and some other things. I need constantly check and update this
page, because all things are changing.

This page is a part of my [zettelkasten](./zettelkasten.md).

## Work and long-term projects

This is very important part of my life, it's allow keep my [finance](./finance.md) stable,
live actively and interesting. I'm working now as a software engineer in a small
company (remote, full-stack position, but moving into
[backend](./my%20backend%20developer%20roadmap.md) position).

I organize my work using, [gtd](./getting%20things%20done%20%28gtd%29.md) mainly using Inbox,
Tasks (TODO and NEXT), Daily and Weekly notes.

To follow external timelines I sometimes use [calendar](./calendar.md) events, but it's
secondary task planner.

To connect with colleagues I use [instant messaging](./instant%20messaging.md) and [email](./email.md) clients.

In my work significantly help my [development environment](./development%20environment.md), [backup](./backup.md) plan
and daily [maintenance](./maintenance.md), with attention to [computer security](./computer%20security.md).

Currently, I'm working on social platform automation project.

## Social activity and family

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages. Here is
[how do i work with contacts](./how%20do%20i%20work%20with%20contacts.md) if you need to write something to me.

## Exercise and health

Right now I'm trying to follow my personal [exercise plan](./exercise%20plan.md) and
[my everyday life (routine)](./my%20everyday%20life%20%28routine%29.md) routine.

## Relax and fun

I can also spend time with my family, friends and pets or consume some media,
for example:


- Watching [movies](./my%20movies.md), [twitch](./twitch%20%28service%29.md),
  [youtube](./youtube.md)

- Playing [my games](./my%20games.md)
- Reading [my read books](./my%20read%20books.md) and [news](./news.md)
- Listening [my music](./my%20music.md)
- Art [my art](./my%20art.md)

And of course healthy [sleep](./sleep.md).

## Education and self-development

I'm trying to learn new things every day. Currently, I'm studying (this is
plan):

Here my "to learn" books list: [my read books](./my%20read%20books.md).

Here my "to learn" articles list: [my articles list (publishing)](./my%20articles%20list%20%28publishing%29.md).

Since I'm use [zettelkasten](./zettelkasten.md), I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources, my experience, etc.

To study effectively I use [SQ3R method](./SQ3R%20method.md), [study techniques](./how%20to%20study.md)
and various methods [how to solve it](./how%20to%20solve%20it.md). More information here - [education](./education.md).

It's not enough to study only, need continuously practice (use your knowledge)
and test yourself, to solve this problem I use [spaced repetition](./spaced%20repetition.md) and
implement my [pet projects](./my%20pet%20projects.md) and
[working projects](./work%20%28human%20activity%29.md).

## IRL, government and other things

Check this note [in real life (irl)](./in%20real%20life%20%28irl%29.md).

## Mentoring and helping

I don't think I'm great at this, but I'm trying to help people on [GitHub](./GitHub.md),
and in future on [stack overflow](./stack%20overflow.md). Sometimes on different platforms or IRL.
