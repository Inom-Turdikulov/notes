# Logarithm (logs)

> Part of [mathematics](./mathematics.md). They are related to exponential
> functions. A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a
> certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation.
> Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.

> Logarithms are the inverse operation of exponentiation. We can use logarithms
> to find the exponent to which a given base must be raised in order to produce
> a particular result.

$log2(1024) = 10$, because $2^{10} = 1024$
