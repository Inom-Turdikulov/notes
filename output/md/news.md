# News

> Information about **current events**. This may be provided through many
> different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting,
> **electronic communication**, or through the testimony of observers and
> witnesses to events.
> News is sometimes called "hard news" to differentiate it from soft media
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News)

I usually use [miniflux](./miniflux.md) and [hacker news](./hacker%20news.md) to read
