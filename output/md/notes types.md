title: Notes types which I use with Zettelkasten
---
   
This is initial table of notes types which I use with   
[zettelkasten](./zettelkasten.md). I will update it as I improve my workflow. To set   
note type need just apple tag from left column to note.

| `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_daily}`      | Daily working log                                          |

| `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_research}`   | Literature notes                                           |   
|             |                                                            |
