title: The internet, explained
---

Began as research project in 1969 (ARPANET), commercial network in the 1990s.

Features:


-   decentralized (no one runs the internet)
-   web protocol's
-   traffic exchange based on voluntary interconnection agreements
-   technical standarts for internet are managed by Internet Engineering Task Force
-   ICANN - provide domain names and IP address, it's not control technical stuff of internet.

The last mile: - part, that connects home and small business to the internet.

Data centers - full of servers, which do data processing. Usually located where electricity is cheap.

The backbone - long-distance network that carry data between data-centers and consumers.

Frequently connected together at internet exchange points.

1973 - TCP/IP standart created, it's next generation standart for the ARPANET.
ARAPANET switched to TCP/IP in 1983.

In 1980's internet funding switched from the military to National Science Foundation.ICANN

There are 2 basic types of wireless internet access: wifi and cellular.
WiFi use unlicensed spectrum.

Cellular networks work by breaking up the service territory into cells, each cell has a tower.
When device move from one cell area to other, the network hands off the device from one tower to another.

Cloud computing - provide to consumers computing as a utility, leaving the technical details to technology companies.
Examples: cloud office suite, email services, remote storage, etc.

Packet - basic unit of information transmitted over the internet.
Splitting information into chunks, allow the network's capacity to be used more efficiently.
Packet has 2 parts (size for IPv6 is 65575, ~65KB):


-   header, length of packet, source and destination, checksum to validate packet (for IPv6 40 byte).
-   payload, actual data (for IPv6 65535 bytes)

WWW - World Wide Web, created by Timothy Bearners-Lee in CERN, 1991.
Offered more powerfula and user-friendly interface than other internet applications (hypertext).
The web supported hyperlinks.

In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the web's official standarts organization.
<[https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List>](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List>)

Web and Internet is different things. Web is just one of many internet applications.
Web browser is a computer program that allows user to view websites and download them.
First widely used browser was Mosaic. The Mosaic team moved to California to found Netscape, first commercially successful web browser in 1994.

SSL - Secure Sockets Layer, family of encryption technologies that allows web users to protect the privacy of information they transmit over the internet.
SSL transforming your data into coded message, that only the recipient knows how to decipher.
Introduced in Netscape.
SSL use asymmetric encryption, asymmetric Encryption, also known as Public-Key Cryptography. Unlike “normal” (symmetric) encryption, Asymmetric Encryption encrypts and decrypts the data using two separate yet mathematically connected cryptographic keys. These keys are known as a ‘Public Key’ and a ‘Private Key.’ Together, they’re called a ‘Public and Private Key Pair.’

[ ] TODO Assymetric Encryption

DNS - Domain Name System. It's hierarchical.
.com - Verisign
google.com - Google
mail.google.com - Google


DNSSEC - increase DNS security with encryption.
The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of extension specifications by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

ICCANN administrate domain name system.
There are 2 types of domain names:


-   top-level domains gTLDs (.com, .edu, .org, .gov), autorithy delegated to private organization's. In 2011 ICANN voted to make easier to create new gTLDs, and hundreds of new domains created in result. <[https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt>](https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt>)
-   country-code top-level domains ccTLDs (.us, .uk, .cn, .ru) - administrated by authorities in each country.

Bandwidth - the maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.

Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (MB's).


## The Internet {#the-internet}



#### Front {#front}

Which facts of IP address you know:


-   what is IP address and why it's used?
-   who provide IP address?
-   IPv4 form and amount of addresses
-   IPv6 form and amount of addresses


#### Back {#back}

IP - internet protocol address, used to identify each computer in the internet.
IP address provided by ICANN, and ensure that 2 organizations don't use the same address.
IPv4 address form is nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn is number in 0-255 range.
IPv4 - provide about 4 billion IP addresses.

IPv6 - provide about 340 trillion trillion trillion IP addresses.
FFFF : FFFF : FFFF : FFFF : FFFF : FFFF : FFFF : FFFF
FFFF - is segment, total 8 segments, hexadecimal value 0-FFFF, separated by colons

What's the internet?
?
Internet is the most largest and popular computer network in the world. It's a network of networks.

Part of the internet that connects homes and small businesses, towers to allow cell phones to access the internet are called?
?
The last mile.

What is data center?
?
Data centers are places with rooms of full of servers that store user data and host some services (public/private), like Google and Facebook.
<!--SR:!2023-02-24,2,246-->

What is backbone?
?
Backbone is the part of the internet that connects data centers and customers.
<!--SR:!2023-02-24,2,246-->

What is Internet Exchange Point?
?
An Internet exchange point (IXP) is a physical location through which Internet infrastructure companies such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and CDNs connect with each other.
