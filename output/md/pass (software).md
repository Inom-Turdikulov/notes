# Pass (software)

> Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With pass,
> each password lives inside of a [gpg](./gnu%20privacy%20guard.md) encrypted file whose
> filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the password.
> These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies,
> copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard
> command line file management utilities.
