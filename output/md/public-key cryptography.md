# Public-key cryptography

> Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of
> cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair consists
> of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are generated with
> cryptographic [algorithms](./algorithm.md) based on [mathematical](./mathematics.md)
> problems termed one-way functions. [security](./computer%20security.md) of
> public-key cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret; the public
> key can be openly distributed without compromising security.
