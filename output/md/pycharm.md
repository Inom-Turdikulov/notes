# PyCharm: the Python IDE for Professional Developers by JetBrains

Integrated development environment (IDE) used for programming in Python. It
provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester,
integration with version control systems, and supports web development with
Django (and other [Python](./Python.md) packages). PyCharm is developed by the Czech
company JetBrains (but with Russian roots).

It is cross-platform, working on Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. PyCharm has
a Professional Edition, released under a proprietary license and a Community
Edition released under the Apache License.[2] PyCharm Community Edition is less
extensive than the Professional Edition.
