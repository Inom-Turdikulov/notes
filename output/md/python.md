[zen of python](./zen%20of%20python.md) describes the philosophy of Python.

This is most prioritized language for me. I learn it according to my
[my python developer roadmap](./my%20python%20developer%20roadmap.md).

**Python** [@PythonProgrammingLanguage2023] is a
[high-level](./high-level%20programming%20language.md),
[general-purpose programming language](./general-purpose%20programming%20language.md).

One of key features of Python is attention to [readability](./readability.md), by
using indentation to delimit code blocks, rather than curly brackets or
keywords.

Python is [dynamically typed] and [garbage-collected].

It supports any popular [programming paradigm](./programming%20paradigm.md):


- [structured programming](./structured%20programming.md)
- [procedural programming](./procedural%20programming.md)
- [object-oriented programming](./object-oriented%20programming.md)
- [functional programming](./functional%20programming.md)

Rich [standard library](./the%20python%20standard%20library.md) make it's
"batteries included" language.
