# Ventoy

> Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for
> ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files. With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk
> over and over, you just need to copy the ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files to the
> USB drive and boot them directly. You can copy many files at a time and ventoy
> will give you a boot menu to select them (screenshot). You can also browse
> ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files in local disks and boot them. x86 Legacy BIOS,
> IA32 UEFI, x86_64 UEFI, ARM64 UEFI and MIPS64EL UEFI are supported in the same
> way. Most types of OS supported
> (Windows/WinPE/Linux/ChromeOS/Unix/VMware/Xen...)
