abstract: 'JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used by more software
  developers today than any other programming language. For nearly 25 years this best
  seller has been the go-to guide for JavaScript programmers. The seventh edition
  is fully updated to cover the 2020 version of JavaScript, and new chapters cover
  classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, async/await, and metaprogramming.
  You''ll find illuminating and engaging example code throughout. This book is for
  programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web developers who want to take
  their understanding and mastery to the next level. It begins by explaining the JavaScript
  language itself, in detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation
  to cover the web platform and Node.js. Topics include: Types, values, variables,
  expressions, operators, statements, objects, and arrays Functions, classes, modules,
  iterators, generators, Promises, and async/await JavaScript''s standard library:
  data structures, regular expressions, JSON, i18n, et cetera The web platform: documents,
  components, graphics, networking, storage, and threads Node.js: buffers, files,
  streams, threads, child processes, web clients, and web servers Tools and language
  extensions that professional JavaScript developers rely on.'
