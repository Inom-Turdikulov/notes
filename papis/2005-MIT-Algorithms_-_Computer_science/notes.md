We've partnered with Dartmouth college professors Tom Cormen and Devin Balkcom
to teach introductory computer science algorithms, including searching, sorting,
recursion, and graph theory. Learn with a combination of articles,
visualizations, quizzes, and coding challenges.

## What is an algorithm and why should you care?

Sort of intro in algorithms (beginner-friendly). Where and why algorithms are
used. Described various fields, like algorithms in computer science, algorithms
in mathematics, algorithms in physics, etc.

Which problems can be solved with algorithms. Algorithms analysis, such as
efficiency, complexity, asymptotic analysis, etc.

Here also cool intro into binary search algorithm.

For example, you have array of 600 items. Which formula need use to find guess
number if you use binary search algorithm and what this number will be? ?
$\log_2 x$. Number is 9, since log2(600) = 9.228 = about 9 tries.
