abstract: 'Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling uncertainty and nonstop
  pressure share a common attribute: They care deeply about the practice of creating
  software. They treat it as a craft. They are professionals. In The Clean Coder:
  A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert
  C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software
  craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating
  and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is
  about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect,
  and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult
  decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with
  a responsibility to act. Readers will learn What it means to behave as a true software
  craftsman How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers
  How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer’s block How to handle unrelenting
  pressure and avoid burnout How to combine enduring attitudes with new development
  paradigms How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps
  How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive When to say “No”–and
  how to say it When to say “Yes”–and what yes really means Great software is something
  to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer
  and as a user. Great software isn’t written by machines. It is written by professionals
  with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. The Clean Coder will help you become
  one of them–and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.'
