abstract: 'Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean
  Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies
  are built and new products are launched.


  Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new
  under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in
  a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they
  have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful
  path to a sustainable business.


  The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient
  and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean
  manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning”, rapid scientific experimentation,
  as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product-development
  cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what
  customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering
  plans inch by inch, minute by minute.


  Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers
  entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously,
  to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to
  creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate
  more than ever.
