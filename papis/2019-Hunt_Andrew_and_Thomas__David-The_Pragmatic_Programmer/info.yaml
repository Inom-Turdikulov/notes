  Juniper Networks The Pragmatic Programmer is one of those rare tech books you''ll
  read, re-read, and read again over the years. Whether you''re new to the field or
  an experienced practitioner, you''ll come away with fresh insights each and every
  time. Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote the first edition of this influential book
  in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding.
  These lessons have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of
  software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology,
  and the Pragmatic philosophy has spawned hundreds of books, screencasts, and audio

  this new edition re-examines what it means to be a modern programmer. Topics range
  from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques

  tools Avoid programming by coincidence Learn real requirements Solve the underlying
  problems of concurrent code Guard against security vulnerabilities Build teams of

  and effectively, including property-based testing Implement the Pragmatic Starter
  Kit Delight your users Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled
  with classic and fresh anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies,
  The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best approaches and major pitfalls of many
  different aspects of software development. Whether you''re a new coder, an experienced
