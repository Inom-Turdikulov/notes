  Street Journal Bestselling The Unicorn Project! "The Unicorn Project is amazing,

  Director Platform Engineering, Adidas "Gene Kim does a masterful job of showing

  Patterns This highly anticipated follow-up to the bestselling title The Phoenix
  Project takes another look at Parts Unlimited, this time from the perspective of
  software development. In The Unicorn Project, we follow Maxine, a senior lead developer
  and architect, as she is exiled to the Phoenix Project, to the horror of her friends
  and colleagues, as punishment for contributing to a payroll outage. She tries to
  survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within
  a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork,
  and approvals. One day, she is approached by a ragtag bunch of misfits who say they
  want to overthrow the existing order, to liberate developers, to bring joy back
  to technology work, and to enable the business to win in a time of digital disruption.
  To her surprise, she finds herself drawn ever further into this movement, eventually
  becoming one of the leaders of the Rebellion, which puts her in the crosshairs of
  some familiar and very dangerous enemies. The Age of Software is here, and another
  mass extinction event looms--this is a story about rebel developers and business
  leaders working together, racing against time to innovate, survive, and thrive in
  a time of unprecedented uncertainty...and opportunity. "The Unicorn Project provides
  insanely useful insights on how to improve your technology business."--DOMINICA
  DEGRANDIS, author of Making Work Visible and Director of Digital Transformation
  at Tasktop ------ "My goal in writing The Unicorn Project was to explore and reveal
  the necessary but invisible structures required to make developers (and all engineers)
  productive, and reveal the devastating effects of technical debt and complexity.
  I hope this book can create common ground for technology and business leaders to
  leave the past behind, and co-create a better future together."--Gene Kim, November
