abstract: Updated and Expanded for Python 3 It’s easy to start developing programs
  with Python, which is why the language is so popular. However, Python’s unique strengths,
  charms, and expressiveness can be hard to grasp, and there are hidden pitfalls that
  can easily trip you up. This second edition of Effective Python will help you master
  a truly “Pythonic” approach to programming, harnessing Python’s full power to write
  exceptionally robust and well-performing code. Using the concise, scenario-driven
  style pioneered in Scott Meyers’ best-selling Effective C++ , Brett Slatkin brings
  together 90 Python best practices, tips, and shortcuts, and explains them with realistic
  code examples so that you can embrace Python with confidence. Drawing on years of
  experience building Python infrastructure at Google, Slatkin uncovers little-known
  quirks and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You’ll understand
  the best way to accomplish key tasks so you can write code that’s easier to understand,
  maintain, and improve. In addition to even more advice, this new edition substantially
  revises all items from the first edition to reflect how best practices have evolved.
  Key features include 30 new actionable guidelines for all major areas of Python
  Detailed explanations and examples of statements, expressions, and built-in types
  Best practices for writing functions that clarify intention, promote reuse, and
  avoid bugs Better techniques and idioms for using comprehensions and generator functions
  Coverage of how to accurately express behaviors with classes and interfaces Guidance
  on how to avoid pitfalls with metaclasses and dynamic attributes More efficient
  and clear approaches to concurrency and parallelism Solutions for optimizing and
  hardening to maximize performance and quality Techniques and built-in modules that
  aid in debugging and testing Tools and best practices for collaborative development
  Effective Python will prepare growing programmers to make a big impact using Python
