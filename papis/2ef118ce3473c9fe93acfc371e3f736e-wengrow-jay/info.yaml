abstract: If you thought that data structures and algorithms were all just theory,
  you're missing out on what they can do for your code. Learn to use Big O Notation
  to make your code run faster by orders of magnitude. Choose from data structures
  such as hash tables, trees, and graphs to increase your code's efficiency exponentially.
  With simple language and clear diagrams, this book makes this complex topic accessible,
  no matter your background. This new edition features practice exercises in every
  chapter, and new chapters on topics such as dynamic programming and heaps and tries.
  Get the hands-on info you need to master data structures and algorithms for your
  day-to-day work. Algorithms and data structures are much more than abstract concepts.
  Mastering them enables you to write code that runs faster and more efficiently,
  which is particularly important for today's web and mobile apps. Take a practical
  approach to data structures and algorithms, with techniques and real-world scenarios
  that you can use in your daily production code, with examples in JavaScript, Python,
  and Ruby. This new and revised second edition features new chapters on recursion,
  dynamic programming, and using Big O in your daily work. Use Big O notation to measure
  and articulate the efficiency of your code, and modify your algorithm to make it
  faster. Find out how your choice of arrays, linked lists, and hash tables can dramatically
  affect the code you write. Use recursion to solve tricky problems and create algorithms
  that run exponentially faster than the alternatives. Dig into advanced data structures
  such as binary trees and graphs to help scale specialized applications such as social
  networks and mapping software. You'll even encounter a single keyword that can give
  your code a turbo boost. Practice your new skills with exercises in every chapter,
  along with detailed solutions. Use these techniques today to make your code faster
  and more scalable.
