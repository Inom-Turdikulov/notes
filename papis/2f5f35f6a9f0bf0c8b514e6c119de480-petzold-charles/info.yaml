abstract: What do flashlights, the British invasion, black cats, and seesaws have
  to do with computers? In CODE, they show us the ingenious ways we manipulate language
  and invent new means of communicating with each other. And through CODE, we see
  how this ingenuity and our very human compulsion to communicate have driven the
  technological innovations of the past two centuries. Using everyday objects and
  familiar language systems such as Braille and Morse code, author Charles Petzold
  weaves an illuminating narrative for anyone who’s ever wondered about the secret
  inner life of computers and other smart machines. It’s a cleverly illustrated and
  eminently comprehensible story—and along the way, you’ll discover you’ve gained
  a real context for understanding today’s world of PCs, digital media, and the Internet.
  No matter what your level of technical savvy, CODE will charm you—and perhaps even
  awaken the technophile within.
