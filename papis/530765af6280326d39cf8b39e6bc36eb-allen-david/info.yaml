abstract: Since it was first published almost fifteen years ago, David Allen’s Getting
  Things Done has become one of the most influential business books of its era, and
  the ultimate book on personal organization. “GTD” is now shorthand for an entire
  way of approaching professional and personal tasks, and has spawned an entire culture
  of websites, organizational tools, seminars, and offshoots. Allen has rewritten
  the book from start to finish, tweaking his classic text with important perspectives
  on the new workplace, and adding material that will make the book fresh and relevant
  for years to come. This new edition of Getting Things Done will be welcomed not
  only by its hundreds of thousands of existing fans but also by a whole new generation
  eager to adopt its proven principles.
