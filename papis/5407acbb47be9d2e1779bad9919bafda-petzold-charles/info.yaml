abstract: 'Programming Legend Charles Petzold unlocks the secrets of the extraordinary
  and prescient 1936 paper by Alan M. Turing** Mathematician Alan Turing invented
  an imaginary computer known as the Turing Machine; in an age before computers, he
  explored the concept of what it meant to be *computable* , creating the field of
  computability theory in the process, a foundation of present-day computer programming.
  The book expands Turing’s original 36-page paper with additional background chapters
  and extensive annotations; the author elaborates on and clarifies many of Turing’s
  statements, making the original difficult-to-read document accessible to present
  day programmers, computer science majors, math geeks, and others. Interwoven into
  the narrative are the highlights of Turing’s own life: his years at Cambridge and
  Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during World War II, his involvement
  in seminal computer projects, his speculations about artificial intelligence, his
  arrest and prosecution for the crime of "gross indecency," and his early death by
  apparent suicide at the age of 41.'
