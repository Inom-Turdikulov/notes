abstract: 'Widely considered one of the best practical guides to programming, Steve
  McConnell’s original CODE COMPLETE has been helping developers write better software
  for more than a decade. Now this classic book has been fully updated and revised
  with leading-edge practices—and hundreds of new code samples—illustrating the art
  and science of software construction. Capturing the body of knowledge available
  from research, academia, and everyday commercial practice, McConnell synthesizes
  the most effective techniques and must-know principles into clear, pragmatic guidance.
  No matter what your experience level, development environment, or project size,
  this book will inform and stimulate your thinking—and help you build the highest
  quality code. Discover the timeless techniques and strategies that help you: Design
  for minimum complexity and maximum creativity Reap the benefits of collaborative
  development Apply defensive programming techniques to reduce and flush out errors
  Exploit opportunities to refactor—or evolve—code, and do it safely Use construction
  practices that are right-weight for your project Debug problems quickly and effectively
  Resolve critical construction issues early and correctly Build quality into the
  beginning, middle, and end of your project.'
