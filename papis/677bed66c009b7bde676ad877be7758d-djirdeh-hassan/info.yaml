abstract: Front-end web development has become astoundingly complex. If you’ve never
  used a modern JavaScript framework, building your first app that just displays “Hello”
  can take a whole week! That might sound ridiculous, but most frameworks assume knowledge
  of the terminal, advanced JavaScript, and tools such as the Node Package Manager
  (NPM), Babel, Webpack, and sometimes more. Vue, refreshingly, doesn’t assume. We
  call it the “progressive” JavaScript framework because it scales down as well as
  it scales up. If your app is simple, you can use Vue just like jQuery - by dropping
  in a tag. But as your skills and needs grow more advanced, Vue grows with you to
  make you more powerful and productive.
