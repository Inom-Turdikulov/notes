abstract: This book is Part I of the fourth edition of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin
  Wayneâ€™s Algorithms , the leading textbook on algorithms today, widely used in colleges
  and universities worldwide. Part I contains Chapters 1 through 3 of the book. The
  fourth edition of Algorithms surveys the most important computer algorithms currently
  in use and provides a full treatment of data structures and algorithms for sorting,
  searching, graph processing, and string processing -- including fifty algorithms
  every programmer should know. In this edition, new Java implementations are written
  in an accessible modular programming style, where all of the code is exposed to
  the reader and ready to use. The algorithms in this book represent a body of knowledge
  developed over the last 50 years that has become indispensable, not just for professional
  programmers and computer science students but for any student with interests in
  science, mathematics, and engineering, not to mention students who use computation
  in the liberal arts. The companion web site, algs4.cs.princeton.edu contains    An
  online synopsis   Full Java implementations   Test data   Exercises and answers   Dynamic
  visualizations   Lecture slides   Programming assignments with checklists   Links
  to related material   The MOOC related to this book is accessible via the "Online
  Course" link at algs4.cs.princeton.edu. The course offers more than 100 video lecture
  segments that are integrated with the text, extensive online assessments, and the
  large-scale discussion forums that have proven so valuable. Offered each fall and
  spring, this course regularly attracts tens of thousands of registrants. Robert
  Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne are developing a modern approach to disseminating knowledge
  that fully embraces technology, enabling people all around the world to discover
  new ways of learning and teaching. By integrating their textbook, online content,
  and MOOC, all at the state of the art, they have built a unique resource that greatly
  expands the breadth and depth of the educational experience.
