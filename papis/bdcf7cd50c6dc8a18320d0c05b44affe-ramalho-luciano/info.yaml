abstract: 'Python’s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often
  means you aren’t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you’ll
  learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly
  most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core
  language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster,
  and more readable at the same time. Many experienced programmers try to bend Python
  to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features
  outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly
  learn how to become proficient in Python 3. This book covers: * **Python data model:**
  understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects
  * **Data structures:** take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the
  text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age * **Functions as objects:** view Python
  functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design
  patterns * **Object-oriented idioms:** build classes by learning about references,
  mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance * **Control
  flow:** leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with
  the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages * **Metaprogramming:** understand how
  properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work.'
