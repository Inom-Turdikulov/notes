abstract: A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics uses your familiarity with ideas
  from programming and software to teach mathematics. You'll learn about the central
  objects and theorems of mathematics, covering graphs, calculus, linear algebra,
  eigenvalues, optimization, and more. You'll also be immersed in the often unspoken
  cultural attitudes of mathematics, learning both how to read and write proofs while
  understanding why mathematics is the way it is. Between each technical chapter is
  an essay describing a different aspect of mathematical culture, and discussions
  of the insights and meta-insights that constitute mathematical intuition.As you
  learn, we'll use new mathematical ideas to create wondrous programs, from cryptographic
  schemes to neural networks to hyperbolic tessellations. Each chapter also contains
  a set of exercises that have you actively explore mathematical topics on your own.
  By the end of the book, you will be able to learn mathematics on your own. In short,
  this book will teach you to engage with mathematics.This is the ebook edition, a
  full-color pdf containing the complete contents of the book (the physical book is
  black and white). Due to the heavy use of mathematical typesetting, there is no
  plan for a ebook-reader-specific format (mobi, epub). This ebook is a simple pdf
  download.
