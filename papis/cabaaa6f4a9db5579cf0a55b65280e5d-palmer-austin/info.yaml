abstract: This comprehensive guide will help you master the Palmer Method of writing
  so you can achieve perfect cursive handwriting. In a series of rapid, plain, unshaded,
  coarse-pen writing lessons, this guide will enable you to adopt a neat cursive writing
  style with rhythmic motions. The Palmer Method suggests that writing should be an
  exercise of the entire arm, not just the wrist and fingers. This assists writers
  in keeping their words legible, while writing quickly and painlessly. Focused on
  business writing, rather than the art of calligraphy, no artistic talent is required
  to master this skill. Complete with the original illustrations and diagrams, this
  1901 book provides easy-to-follow instructions for learners of all ages. Austin
  Palmer developed the Palmer Method of handwriting in the late 19th century with
  the aim of simplifying the standardised Spencerian Method of cursive writing. Palmerâ€™s
  method quickly became the most popular handwriting style in America. Read \& Co.
  Books is proud to have republished this new edition of The Palmer Method of Business
  Writing, featuring an introductory biography of the author. Not to be missed by
  those with a keen interest in the history and development of penmanship.
