> The piano is a **keyboard [[my music|musical]] instrument** with
> strings struck by wooden hammers coated with a softer material (modern hammers
> are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is
> played using its keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) touched by
> the performer with the fingers and thumbs of both hands, causing the hammers
> to strike the strings. It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori
> around the year 1700.
