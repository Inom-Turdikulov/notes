# Polygon (computer graphics)

> Polygons are used in [[computer graphics]] to compose images that are
> three-dimensional in [[polygon mesh|appearance]].
>
> Usually (but not always) triangular, polygons arise when an object's surface
> is modeled, vertices are selected, and the object is rendered in a wire frame
> model. This is quicker to display than a shaded model; thus the polygons are a
> stage in computer animation. The polygon count refers to the number of
> polygons being rendered per frame.
>
> Beginning with the fifth generation of video [[game]] consoles, the use of
> polygons became more common, and with each succeeding generation, polygonal
> models became increasingly complex.
