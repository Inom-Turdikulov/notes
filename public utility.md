# Public utility

> A public utility company (usually just utility) is an organization that
> maintains the infrastructure for a public service (often also providing a
> service using that infrastructure). Public utilities are subject to forms of
> public control and regulation ranging from local community-based groups to
> statewide government monopolies.
>
> Many utilities are essential for human
> [[in real life (irl)|life]], national defense, or commerce, and
> the risk of public harm with mismanagement is considerably greater than with
> other goods.
