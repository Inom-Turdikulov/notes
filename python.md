[[zen of python]] describes the philosophy of Python.

This is most prioritized language for me. I learn it according to my
[[my python developer roadmap]].

**Python** [@PythonProgrammingLanguage2023] is a
[[high-level programming language|high-level]],
[[general-purpose programming language]].

One of key features of Python is attention to [[readability]], by
using indentation to delimit code blocks, rather than curly brackets or
keywords.

Python is [dynamically typed] and [garbage-collected].

It supports any popular [[programming paradigm]]:

- [[structured programming]]
- [[procedural programming]]
- [[object-oriented programming]]
- [[functional programming]]

Rich [[the python standard library|standard library]] make it's
"batteries included" language.
