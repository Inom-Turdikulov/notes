# Recursion (computer science)

> Method of solving a [[computational problem|computation problem]]
> where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same
> problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call
> themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many
> types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of
> [[computer science|computer science]].

*Tree created using the Logo programming language and relying heavily on
recursion. Each branch can be seen as a smaller version of a tree.*
