A Programmer's Introduction to [[mathematics]] uses your
familiarity with ideas from [[Computer_programming|programming]]
and software to teach mathematics. You'll learn about the central objects and
theorems of mathematics, covering graphs, calculus, linear algebra, eigenvalues,
optimization, and more. You'll also be immersed in the often unspoken cultural
attitudes of mathematics, learning both how to read and write proofs while
understanding why mathematics is the way it is. Between each technical chapter
is an essay describing a different aspect of mathematical culture, and
discussions of the insights and meta-insights that constitute mathematical
intuition.

As you learn, we'll use new mathematical ideas to create wondrous programs, from
cryptographic schemes to neural networks to hyperbolic tessellations. Each
chapter also contains a set of exercises that have you actively explore
mathematical topics on your own. By the end of the book, you will be able to
learn mathematics on your own. In short, this book will teach you to engage with
mathematics.
