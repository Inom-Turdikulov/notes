`M-z`::toggle X-ray

`S-d`::duplicate, you can also use mesh > duplicate. After duplicate clone
locked to your cursor, you can press `ESC` to cancel the move.

When you duplicate vertices, you can press `p` to separate them into a new mesh.

You can select linked vertices by ==`Ctrl-L`==, it can help if you don't separate
them and deselected vertices by accident.

`F2`::rename any selected object

`Hold Shift`::Allow to drag/set value more precisely

`Hold Control`::Allow to drag/set value incrementally or enable snapping

`Z`::toggle render mode

Probably better to place `subdivision modifier` on bottom of the stack (depends on the situation)

You can toggle snapping by ==`Shift-Tab`==.
