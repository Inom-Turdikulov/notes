# An introduction to Blender 4.x

At the end of this course, you will be able to comfortably navigate Blender
3D and have a solid understanding of what's possible.

And I think more important, you can understand basic concepts of 3D
graphics and how to work with it.

# 1 Intro to Blender 4.0

Interface is too small, how I can adjust it?
?
You can adjust resolution scale for UI in `Blender Preferences` â†’ `UI`.
<!--SR:!2023-12-24,4,270-->

# 2: Navigating the 3D View

How to zoom in/out?
?
You zoom-in/zoom-out by using `Magnifier` icon in top right of 3D view and
move by hand icon or just use mouse wheel.

What is basic concept of Orthographic view?
?
[[Orthographic_projection|Orthographic]] view remove our perspective
distortion.
<!--SR:!2023-12-21,1,230-->

How I can find hotkey for some action?
?
If you are not able to remember hotkey, try to check it in panels controls
(hover) or context menus. You can also use `F3` key to search for hotkey.

How to quickly navigate in 3D view (top, bottom, left, front, etc.)?
?
You can use `NUM1-9` keys. But using `Pie menu` for navigation (````) I
think more suitable than `Num` keys (on my keyboard at least).

You can enable 3 keys Mouse emulation (`Settings` â†’ `Input`), which might be
useful for tablet and with this mode some additional keybindings will
aviable:
1. `M-LMB` for orbiting
2. `S-M-LMB` for pan navigate
3. `C-A-LMB` for zoom

# 3: Selecting Objects

To deselect everything click on free space, or press ==`M-A`==.

How to select multiple individual objects (outliner and in the 3D view)?
?
In the outliner you can hold `C-` key to select individual objects.
In blender to select multiple items, hold `S-` key and click using `LMB`.
<!--SR:!2023-12-23,3,250-->

How to deselect individual objects (outliner and in the 3D view)?
?
To deselect in the 3D view use `S-` and click `LMB` 2 times, in the
outliner, use `C-` key to deselect individual items.

How to determine active object in 3D view?
?
Blender mark active object using light orange glow (border).

How blender mark hidden toolbars in UI?
?
You can expose additional tools from toolbar, if here small triangle (on
left sidebar for example) and you can extend them by resizing to right.

Can you describe how rotation works (mnemonic/IRL example) per axis (X, Y, Z)?
?
X - is sort of cartwheel exercise, ðŸ¤¸
Y - is front/backflip
Z - is pirouetting

# 4: Transforming Objects and Adjusting Transformations

Little squares in Gizmo move tool move object in ==2 axes (plane)==.
<!--SR:!2023-12-23,3,250-->

White circle in rotate tool allow you to rotate object at given degree
==`C-`, `C-S-`== keys allow you to work with fixed values of degree.
<!--SR:!2023-12-23,3,250-->

`Scale cage tool` acts like ==`transform tool`== in raster editors, but in
3D space.

In blender when you rotate object, arm is matter, long arm ==slow==
rotation, short arm fast rotation.
<!--SR:!2023-12-23,3,250-->

To reset values, hover on it and press ==`BCK`==.
<!--SR:!2023-12-23,3,250-->

You can use math in input values, for example $2+2$ or $2*2$.

How to transform object with more precision or determine values?
?
You can transform objects using precision (`S-` key) or determine values
using `C-` or `C-S-` keys.
<!--SR:!2023-12-23,3,250-->

You can clear object transformation by ==`M-G, M-R, M-S`== keys.
<!--SR:!2023-12-23,3,250-->

# 5: Adding, Deleting, and the 3D Cursor

Is context menu and object deletion aviable in outliner?
?
In outliner deletion and context menus also works.

How to quickly snap selection or cursor (grid, world origin, etc.)?
?
You can locate 3D cursor from snap menu (`Object` â†’ `Snap` â†’ `Cursor to`). You
can also snap objects in same manner. Or use `S-S` shortcut. Or you can use
new snapping `G` â†’ `B`...

How to quickly add mesh primitives (cube, cylinder, etc.)?
?
Add mesh tools (cube, cylinder, etc.) from left sidebar is useful to
quickly generate meshes and snap them to geometry automatically.

# 6: Local Space and Parenting

How transformation works in blender, is there any specific order?
?
In blender transformation has priorities, for example rotation is calculated
first and then scale.

To change current transformation orientation, use ==`,`== key.

Applying rotation, is sort of make object to use global ==axis (transform
orientation)==.

By default, object origin reference point is ==world origin==.
But you can change this by parenting, when you parent child to parent,
reference point will be parent origin.

You can parent objects by moving them in outliner with ==`S-`== key from
child to parent. And you can clear parent hierarchy by moving them with
`S-` key in outliner, from parent to outside (clear space).

When you parent child object to target object, ==target object== must be
selected and active to make it parent (selected last).

# 7: Editing Object Data

How to open object data in outliner?
?
You can click on object icon or object data icon in outliner and this will
open associated tab in properties.

Object vs Object Data?
?
Object is sort of container, which can store other objects and object data.
You can also change objects data from one to another one. Also object has
own properties and object data (data block) has own properties.

# 8: Edit Mode and Object Origins

Does vertices and edges have size?
?
Vertices haven't size in blender and edges are infinity thin.

If I remove all geometry from object, origin will be still present?
?
Each object has origin, even if you remove all geometry this origin will be
still present.

How to add append geometry to object?
?
You can add additional geometry in edit mode. `S-A` â†’ select something to
add.

You can select specific object, which added in edit mode (for example
multiple cubes), by selecting part of mesh and select ==linked (`C-L`)==.
Then you can separate this object by `P` key and join back (child to
parent) by `C-J` key.

How to set origin to geometry center?
?
Use `Set Origin` â†’ `Origin to Geometry` (or `Origin to Center of Mass`).

How to transform only object origin?
?
Transform tools support additional options (top right corner). For example
`Options` â†’ `Affect Only` â†’ `Origins`. `Only locations`, is useful when you
select two objects and scale for example (object not scaled, changed only
locations). `Parents only`, transform only parent object.

To quickly change current mode for object, you can use PIE menu -
==`C-TAB`==. In keymap settings you can set only `TAB` key for this menu.

You usually need to model object in edit mode, but rotate it in ==object
mode==, to keep its local orientation.

# 9: Duplicate and Instance Objects

How to duplicate object and place it in same place?
?
After duplication of object you can instantly move it. To keep it in exact
same place, use `ESC` key (cancel move operation). Duplication copy object
so if you change one object, another will be not changed.

Duplicate linked (`ALT-D`) create linked copy, it duplicates object but not
their ==data==, and move them. Linked instances much more effective in
terms of memory usage and rendering. And it's working for various objects:
Light, Geometry, Camera, etc.

# 10: Pivot Points, Snapping, and Proportional Editing

How to change pivot point?
?
You can change transform pivot point (center of the header section), for
example rotate around 3D cursor, or bounding box center, or around active
object, or around median point.

How to change grid size?
?
You can change grid scale in `Show Overlays` menu (top right), this is
useful for snapping for example. You can also change scene units, which
also affect to grid and objects (for example location)! (`Scene` tab â†’
`Unit scale`).

How to quickly set object dimensions to 1 meter for example?
?
Blender support unit prefixes in values, for example 1 mm, 1 cm, 1 m, 1 km,
etc. If you type 1 km in some input it will be automatically converted to
meters.

You can enable `Absolute Grid Snap` in snapping settings, to snap object by
==pivot center== all time, no matter what initial position was.

Which snapping modes are available?
?
You can use different modes of snapping: `vertex` (snap to the nearest
vertex), `edge`, `face` (you can also auto-rotate snapping object to face,
with `Align rotation` to `Target option`). And you can also snap by
specific axe (X, Y, Z), this useful in vertex snapping mode for example to
snap near vertices.

`Proportion editing` allow you to edit multiple vertices or objects, which
are in some radius from active vertex/object. You can change radius by
mouse wheel or ==`f` / `F`== keys. You can also use different fallow-of types
(smooth, sphere, sharp, linear, etc.).

Moving 3D cursor with holding ==`S-`== and then `C-` and `RMB` will snap it
to grid or other snapping mode (useful to snap per vertices for example).

You can select through objects by some path (multiple objects, first,
second, etc.), by ==`S-LMB`== keys.

How to adjust wireframe shading?
?
You can adjust wireframe (and any other) shading in dropdown menu, for
example x-ray transparency, background color, etc.

How to quickly hide all UI elements?
?
To see plain scene (without UI), you can just disable overlays and gizmo
(top right menu).

Can shading PIE menu be customized?
?
You can add extra shading pie (Z) menu items in keymap settings.

You can hide/show multiple objects in outliner, by holding and dragging
==`LMB`== key on eye icon.

I can't see my object in viewport, and can't enable visibility in outliner,
what I can do?
?
Outliner has additional `Restriction Toggles` (Filter icon), if you not see
some object which must be visible, try to enable `Disable in Viewport` icon
in `Filter` â†’ `Restriction toggles` items.

How to hide collection completely and make it non-selectable?
?
You can hide entire collection from all modes and disable selecting items
from it by `Excluded from View layer` (checkbox) toggle in Outliner.

How to place object in multiple collections?
?
To place objects to multiple collections use Link to Collection (`S-M`).

How to delete collection and objects in it?
?
You delete collection and objects in it by context menu (`RMB` on
collection) and `Delete Hierarchy`.

How to select all objects in collection?
?
You can select all objects in collection by `RMB` on collection and click
on `Select Objects`.

You can group multiple objects by Empty object and parenting ==(`C-P`)==,
useful when you need to transform group of items and visualize selection of
them in viewport.

TODO: note backface culling (can be enabled in shading options).

Can shade smooth be applied to individual faces?
?
Yes, shade smooth can be applied to individual faces, select face in face
mode (3) and then apply it from context menu.

How to set angle for shade smooth?
?
Apply `Shade Auto Smooth`, and then you can change shade smooth angle in
operations menu (appear in bottom left or F9).
Shade smooth by Angle very useful to smooth for example cylinder with angle
of $30\degree$.

How to mark sharp edges?
?
You can mark specific edge as sharp, select it, `RMB` and `Mark Sharp`.

How to flip normals?
?
You can flip normal by selecting it and press `M-N`, then `flip`.

# 13: The Extrude, Inset, and Knife Tools

Extrusion face in blender means?
?
Extrusion face (E) - create copy of face, move it and attach back to
original face, original face will be deleted.

How to cancel active operation?
?
To really cancel some action, like extrusion operation press `ESC` key and
then `C-Z` to undo (if required).

What difference between `Extrude Faces` and `Extrude Mainfold`?
?
`Extrude Mainfold` tool - attempt to extrude face and "trying" not create
additional faces.
> This tool is very similar to `Extrude Faces` but enables Dissolve
> Orthogonal Edges by default. This causes the tool to automatically split
> and remove adjacent faces when extruding inward

What is Extrude along normals?
?
`Extrude along normals` - extrude face along its normal vector (check also
`Offset Even` option), effect usually visible with multiple faces.

`Knife tool` - to confirm cut press ==`Enter`==.

Knife tool - `A` toggle ==angle constrain==.

Knife tool - `S` toggle ==distance measurement==.

Knife tool - `C` toggle ==cut through===.

How create multiple cuts with knife tool?
?
To create multiple cuts, press `RMB` when you want to finish cut and start
new one.

To cut geometry along a plane use ==`Bisect`== tool (in Knife submenu), but
select first all geometry.

How to quickly select extrusion mode?
?
`M-E` open extrude menu, which allow you to extrude along normals,
individual faces, etc.

# 14 - Bevel and Edge Loops

You can use bevel tool ==(`C-B`)== on edges and vertices (`V` to toggle,
`C-S-B` to start with vertices). Good shape to training is box.

You can adjust many bevel parameters (operations menu), for example you can
create custom `Profile Type`, which allow you to create ==custom bevel
shape==.

Bevel looks weird in some specific shape, how to fix it?
?
Usually before you bevel object, you need to apply scale (`C-A`).

When you use Loop-Cut (`C-R`) you can hold `LMB` to ==slide on edge==.

Before loop cut you can adjust segments amount using ==mouse scroll==.

To move edge quickly and regardless object rotation use `Edge slide` tool.

How to select edge/face loop?
?
`M-LMB` and `C-M-LMB` can select edge/face loop (use it in different select
modes).

Loop cut can't go through face with ==5+ edges (ngon's)== and through
triangles.

# 15 - Subdivide, Fill, and Merge

To subdivide Edges, go too Edge and Subdivide (split edges/faces in half),
or RMB â†’ Subdivide. Sometimes it's can replace loop cut, since it allow you
to subdivide edges more precisely and solve ngon/triangle loop cut problem
(you can select path to subdivide).

To subdivide Edge ring, go to Edge and Subdivide Edge Ring.

You can't subdivide n-gons, but you can use knife tool to cut it.

You can extrude to cursor from many tools, hold C- and press, this is
useful to create vertex in specific place (Edit mode, vertex mode).

You can create edge (and face too!) from just 2 vertices by selecting them
and press F key (Vertex â†’ New Edge/Face from Vertices). And this is not
Knife tool, it's just creating edge between 2 vertices or faces, etc.

M-F - fill face (not same as F), it will fill face with triangles (use Face
â†’ Grid fill to will with quads).

To connect vertices, create edge and split it use J key.

To use auto-merge (merge vertices moved to same location), enable it in
options menu (top right) or control button (also top right) and usually you
need to enable snapping by vertex.

To create some form from edge loops (for example tunnel), select edges,
then Edge menu â†’ Bridge Edge Loops.

# 16 - Object Modifiers

Where is bevel modifier? ? Modifiers â†’ Add Modifier â†’ Generate â†’ Bevel.

You can hide displaying modifier in Edit mode by clicking on icon in right
of modifier name.

You can add bevel weight (Edge â†’ Add bevel weight) to edges and use it in
bevel modifier to bevel only edges with specific weight.

If your bevel modifier not working (usually when you add some loop-cut),
check Geometry â†’ Clamp Overlap.

Array modifier create copies of shape with some offset. And here multiple
options to control, for example offsets.

Mirror modifier mirror object by some axis, and it's working from object
origin.

You can enable mesh symmetry in edit mode (top right), which working for
moving, but it's not working with adding and removing geometry. But usually
mirror modifier is better. You can cut half of geometry, apply mirror
modifier (enable clipping optionally) and then transformations will be
applied to both sides.

You can instantly type something in menus, to quickly find element.

# 17 - Editors and Windows

You can temporarily hide toolbar by T key.

View menu can be used to quickly show/hide required panels.

Blender hotkeys working on active editor (mouse hover on which one). For
example, you can maximize CURRENT editor by C-space key.

To toggle `4 view` mode, use C-ALT-Q.

You can zoom current editor by C-MMB.

You create new window (to place on second monitor for example) from current
editor, View (also aviable in Context Menu) â†’ Area â†’ Duplicate Area into
New Window. Or use S-LMB drag from corner of current editor.

You can adjust current tool mode per various workspace from Workspace tab
in Tool options (N â†’ Tool â†’ Workspace for example).

File â†’ Defaults can help you to permanent save current settings (tools,
workspaces, etc.) into startup file or reset all of them.

# 18 - Working With Blend Files

You can use default UI when opening Blend file (yes they saved in blend
files), in Open dialog click on Gear icon (top-right) and uncheck Load UI.

You can open autosave file from File â†’ Recover â†’ Autosave window. Enable it
in Settings â†’ Save & Load settings.

Blender support Copy-Paste between same versions (or same major versions),
you can use C-C and C-V between window instances.

Blender support appending blend files (copy) or linking (reference)
objects.

Linked objects properties can be overwritten, to overwrite: Menu â†’ Object â†’
Library â†’ Make.

You can unlink objects from Object â†’ Relations â†’ Make Local â†’ All or any
other.

Solid shading mode support textures, check top right menu (shading menu).

Blender (by default) not storing textures in blend files, so be careful. If
you move texture somewhere, blender don't track this changes, and then you
need to manually relink texture. But you can pack this texture into blend
file (File â†’ External Data â†’ Pack Resources).

# 19 - Cameras and Rendering

Render is happens from current active camera (Black triangle on top). You
can change active camera in scene settings (Properties panel â†’ Scene tab).
Or use C+NUM0 keybinding.

You usually need to rotate camera on Z-axis. Or better rotate/transform
from local camera orientation (R â†’ X,Y and G-Z)

Clipping affect to Z-fighting, try to change it if you see weird
artifacts.

You can render viewport from View â†’ Viewport Render Image.

Material shading mode use EEVEE render.

To render image with transparency go to Render settings â†’ Film and enable
Transparent.

# 20 - Materials and Lighting

You can drag & drop colors/materials between material properties.

You can adjust viewport material in Viewport Display tab of Material
properties.

You can input values without zero, for example 0.5 can be `.5`.

Yellow dot in Color property usually indicate that you can add some node to
this property.

Alternative to Sky texture is Environment texture (HDR). Is used to light
your scene using an environment map image file as a texture. NOTE: disable
transparency in render settings, if you use Environment Texture. To rotate
this texture change Vector input (Directions of texture) In Surface tab to
Vector Mapping, then In second vector input set Texture Coordinates to
Generated and adjust required properties.

Use C-M-NUM0 to snap camera to view.

To make shadow more soft, change radius in light properties, or you can use
circle control (aviable for selected light source) in viewport.

Sunlight type - position is no matter, only rotation and point location is
matter.

# 21 - Intro to 3D Animation

You can click on frames number above animation timeline to jump to specific
frame.

When you create animation, first you select WHEN it starts and then WHEN it
finishes. So you need at least 2 keyframes. If you have only 1 keyframe
animation starts and will continue forever. You need to change properties
before you insert keyframe.

Keyframe animation have visual marks in object properties, yellow - we on
some keyframe, green - we are in interpolation between keyframes, orange -
we changed some property, and it's not key framed.

You can insert keyframes in properties, hover on property and press I key.

You can open channels menu in animation timeline, click on small arrow on
left.

You can delete not required properties from channels menu. And then you are
able to change them without key framing.

To quickly toggle Graph Editor, press C-TAB in any animation mode panel.

To fiend current frame (zoom & navigate) in graph editor timeline press
`NUM.`

You can enable auto-keyframing (record button in top bar), to automatically
add keyframes when you change properties.

# 22 - 2D Animation with Grease Pencil

You can add Grease Pencil object from Add menu, and it's 3D object, but you
can work with it in 2D mode, and it allows you to go into draw mode if
greace pencil object selected.

You can change brush in top left brush control.

You can change draw stroke object origin to face (and tune offset) to draw
directly on surface.

Grease pencil support layers, you can add them from top right menu or in
Data tab in properties. And you can animate each layer separately.

You can use Emission Surface in Material, it will make object more stylized
for cartoon.

You can move keyframes in Timeline by selecting it and use G â†’ Drag & Drop.

Grace pencil object can have materials.

Grace pencil objects react to lighting, you can disable this behavior in
Layer properties â†’ Turn off Lights.

You can use Standard display space (Rendering â†’ Color Management) to make
colors more like in raster editors.

You can add noise modifier to grease pencil object to make it more natural.
For example these parameters can be used:
- Position: 0.9
- Thickness: 0.5
- Noise scale: 0.2

You can apply Build modifier to grease pencil object to animate for example
how it was drawn (check Timing â†’ Natural Drawing Speed).

# 23 - Intro to Sculpting

To swap direction in sculpting mode, use C- key.

To make crease use Draw sharp tool (Space, 1).

Clay tool used to build natural forms (Space, 2).

Clay Strips used to quickly add volume (Space, 3).

Flatten: Space, 6

Scrape: S-T

Grab, like proportion edit

Elastic Deform, use big radius (more than object) if you want squeeze
object.

Cloth:

To see overlay in object mode, enable it Overlay Options.

To alter mesh topology in sculpting, enable Dyntopo (top right).

You can optimize mesh after sculpting by using Remesh, C-R (top right),
first turn of Dyntopo.

In sculpting their own Subdivision Modifier type - Multiresolution. You can
add it from Modifier tab in Sculpting mode (or just press C-[Number]). It
allows you work on multiple levels of detail. You can change for example
lower resolution detail and then apply it to higher resolution levels. To
add more levels of detail, use Subdivide button in modifier settings.

When you navigate with `Multiresolution`, by default enabled show low resolution
while navigating option (top right â†’ options). You can disable it to see
high resolution mesh all time.

To avoid lumps, prefer to work with low-res mesh and then add more details.
