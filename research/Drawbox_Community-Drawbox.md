# Drawabox - learning the fundamentals of drawing

Site looks well-done and well-organized. It's even contain read the text
feature, which help me as [[English_language|English]] learner.

## Lesson 0: Getting Started

### Introduction

[Drawabox Lesson 0, Part 1: What is Drawabox? - YouTube](https://youtu.be/9708PBUvCQ0).

Drawabox is community of professionals and enthusiasts, who want to develop
their drawing skills.

Content of drawbox continuously improving and based on Peter Han's Dynamic
Sketching course (which he built with his mentor).

Drawabox give you a strong foundation, but require a lot of practice and time.
It's not going to make you professional, but give you essential knowledge and
practice to improve your drawing skills. I like their comparative with MMO, you
start from Newbie and potentially can become a Hero.

Drawabox focus on 3 areas:
- Confident and controlled MARK MAKING - the ability to make the marks you
intend to make, and to keep them smooth and hesitation-free;
- Attentive and fastidious OBSERVATION;
- And the big focus of this course overall: SPATIAL REASONING - the
understanding deep in your brain that despite drawing on a flat page, the things
you're producing exist in a real, [[Three-dimensional_3D_space|three dimensional
world]].

It can be starting point to advanced topics, like lighting, rendering, or
shading (especially spatial reasoning).

### Changing your Mindset

End result (getting better at art) in drawing is getting in your way.

You want to impress someone, but this stresses us out and put into creative
paralysis.

Failure is a beginner's job and not bad at all, it's even critical integral part
of learning process, it's detect your weak points and allow you to improve
yourself by working on them.

You can be ashamed in some field if you are just beginner!

You don't need to find excuses to draw, you at least ready to draw something
on beginner level!

> Everyone following this course is expected to abide by what we call the 50%
> rule, without exception.

What is 50% rule about?
?
1. Improving your skills, first `50%`. Coursework, exercises, studies,
   tutorials, etc.
2. Second `50%` is drawing done for the sake of drawing. In other words, play.
   Experimentation, just throwing yourself at the page and giving yourself full
freedom to just try, even though the result will likely turn out badly.

This is general rule, every minute you spend on learning must be followed by
practice (play). You can do it in various time sessions (day/day or any other).

Why ignoring 50% rule is critical mistake?
?
> It'll help develop skills that do need to be developed at some point, and
> doing it now will help you avoid some stinging disappointment later on.
