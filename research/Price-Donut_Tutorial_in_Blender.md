# Blender Beginner Donut Tutorial

`G`::initiate move, `X`, `Y`, `Z` move along axis

`M-z`::toggle X-ray

`S-d`::duplicate, you can also use mesh > duplicate. After duplicate clone
locked to your cursor, you can press `ESC` to cancel the move.

When you duplicate vertices, you can press `p` to separate them into a new mesh.

You can select linked vertices by ==`Ctrl-L`==, it can help if you don't separate
them and deselected vertices by accident.

`F2`::rename any selected object

`Hold Shift`::Allow to drag/set value more precisely

`Hold Control`::Allow to drag/set value incrementally or enable snapping

`Z`::toggle render mode

Probably better to place `subdivision modifier` on bottom of the stack (depends on the situation)

You can toggle snapping by ==`Shift-Tab`==.

To change world units need ? Scene Properties (properties sidebar) > Units >
Metric

After scaling object, need to apply scale ? Ctrl + A > Scale

You can change shading of object from ==context menu==

How to apply subdivision modifier (or any modifier) ? P > Modifiers Properties >
Add Modifier

How to move siblings points in edit mode ? You need to select point(s) enable
proportional editing (O) and move (G) To increase/decrease proportional editing
radius use mouse wheel

How to move points along axis in proportional editing mode ? Use alt + s to
shrink/fatten proportional editing radius

How select random points in edit mode ? Select > **S**elect Random

Orthographic mode basically means ? that you can't see perspective, only
orthographic view (no depth, objects same size regardless of distance)
