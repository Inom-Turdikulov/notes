# Blender Beginner Donut Tutorial

A big part of this tutorial is also in
[[Blender_common_shortcuts|blender shortcuts]] note.

Probably better to place `subdivision modifier` on bottom of the stack (depends
on the situation)

To change world units need change properties.
?
Scene Properties (properties sidebar) > Units > Metric

How to apply subdivision modifier (or any modifier)
?
Modifier tab > Modifiers Properties > Add Modifier.

How to move siblings points in edit mode
?
You need to select point(s) enable proportional editing (`O`) and move (`G`) To
increase/decrease proportional editing radius use mouse wheel.

How select random points in edit mode
?
Select > **S**elect Random

Orthographic mode basically means
?
That you can't see perspective, only [[Orthographic_projection|orthographic ]]
view (no depth, objects same size regardless of distance).

You can click on circles in axis control widget (top-right) to orbit or ==hold
LMB== on it and drag.

Render working from ==point of view== of camera.

To quickly set camera position:
- Select camera in Scene Collection (right menu).
- Press `N` to open properties' menu.
- Open view tab and check `camera to view` checkbox.
- Select lock to object target.
- Enter into camera view mode (press `Num0`).
- Locate it as needed.
- Uncheck camera to view.

To set material, in properties window (right side), select material tab and
press add new, and set base color and other properties.

# Part 2

After adding new object, in bottom left corner will be temporary (until you not
do any action) available object options, to reopen them press `F9`.

You can quickly change object shading, by ==context menu (right click)==.

One method to smooth object better, is adding subdivision surface modifier in
object properties (right menu).

Subdivision surface split polygon to additional ==4== polygons.

To move sibling vertices use proportional editing mode `O`, or click on icon in
top right. Change how much vertices affected (circle of influence size), use
mouse scroll or use `PgUP`/`PgDown`.

Sometimes useful to hide part of object. One method to do it is select edge, use
grow selection and hide it.

# Part 3

TODO: add note
**Z-fighting**, also called **stitching** or **planefighting**, is a phenomenon
in 3D rendering that occurs when two or more primitives have very similar
distances to the camera. This would cause them to have near-similar or identical
values in the z-buffer, which keeps track of depth. This then means that when a
specific pixel is being rendered, it is ambiguous which one of the two
primitives are drawn in that pixel because the z-buffer cannot distinguish
precisely which one is farther from the other.

The ==Solidify== modifier takes the surface of any mesh and adds depth thickness
to it.

Usually solidify modifier is used ==before== subdivision modifier.

One useful property of solidify modifier is ==Edge data==, used to create crease
or bevel.

You can temporarily hide modifiers in edit (and other modes) by toggle
==visibility in modifier properties (on top after modifier name)==.

Here various types of snapping: for example `face project`. Snapping working
good if you have enough ==geometry (apply subdivision modifier for example)==.

To apply modifier, press arrow button near modifier name and click on apply.

Blender modifiers work from ==top to bottom== (order).

# Part 4

==Shrink wrap== modifier can help with snapping vertices between two objects.
Select target mesh, which vertices need to be snapped. Usually need to place
this modifier above other ones.

## Sculpting

If you have subdivision modifier, which is not applied, sculpting still working
on low-poly mesh, so usually you need to ==apply it==.

Subdivision modifier applying will use ==Viewport== level.

Very handy option for mask tool is =="Front Faces Only"==, which prevent
painting it in opposite faces, you can find it in top toolbar â†’ brush dropdown.

==Mesh filter tool== can be used to apply to inflate/deflate, smooth, random,
etc. for not-masked faces.

You can smooth mask by ==Mask menu (top bar) and select smooth mask==.

To reduce "lumpiness" in model, you can use ==smooth== tool.
