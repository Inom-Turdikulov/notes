# Shell script

> Computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line

> up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup or
> logging, is called a wrapper.

I personally [[my shell scripts|use]] a lot of shell scripts,
mainly for simple tasks or use some of them as wrappers for other programs.
