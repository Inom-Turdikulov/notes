# Sorting algorithm

> Puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are
> numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.
> Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the
> [[computational complexity|efficiency]] of other algorithms (such
> as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists.
> Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing
> human-readable output.
