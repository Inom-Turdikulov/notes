# Style of life

> The term style of [[in real life (irl)|life]] (German: Lebensstil) was used by
> psychiatrist Alfred Adler as one of several constructs describing the dynamics
> of the personality.
>
> The Style of Life reflects the individual's unique, unconscious, and
> repetitive way of responding to (or avoiding) the main tasks of living:
> friendship, love, and work. This style, rooted in a childhood prototype,
> remains consistent throughout life, unless it is changed through depth
> psychotherapy.
