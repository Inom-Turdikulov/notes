# Windows Setup Script

I have own quick-start script for [[Microsoft Windows]]. I tried to make it very
simple and straightforward.

You can check last version here: [win_setup.ps1](./win/win-setup.ps1)

To execute it, you need to run PowerShell as Administrator and execute this command:

```sh
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(''))
```
